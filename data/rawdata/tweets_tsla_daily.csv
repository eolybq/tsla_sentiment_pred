A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason. My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars &amp; batteries in CA &amp; NV as far into future as I can imagine.

Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars. Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faste… All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway. The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery. Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles … The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives. First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3 Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though. The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi? How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive? No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S. Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away. Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars. Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4.

All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :) Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology. Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true."

To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot. Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian &amp; cyclist safety Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this. I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3. That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.

Doug, who I regard as one of the world’s most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering. Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries &amp; deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?

Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom. Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0. First, it’s important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market &amp; has been for a while Please ignore this thread unless you’re interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S &amp; X are producing major positive cash flow &amp; Model 3 is about to do same.

HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."
2018-05-09,"That’s a white rose on my jacket &amp; the choker is a bunch of spikes, not Tesla anything Prob iTunes, but whatever works 4u is fine. Most people don’t buy music &amp; artist earnings from streaming are tiny. Mostly about touring."
2018-05-10,Tesla quarterly all-hands video. Love the shot of wild horses &amp; Giga in winter
2018-05-11,"That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla &amp; SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass … Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange … I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD &amp; performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year. Towards end of next year. Btw, planning to launch Tesla in Turkey later this year. Love your country &amp; will be there in person for the launch. This will work on entire S &amp; X fleet, even first production units. Cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought it."
2018-05-14,"What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death. It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter. This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg. Fair criticism, but we’re fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
2018-05-17,"Yeah, there are thousands of Supercharger locations going through permitting/construction, including that area. Will publish an updated map in the next few days."
2018-05-19,Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive &amp; performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.
2018-05-20,"They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight. Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July. Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions. Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time. Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track. Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec 0-60mph 155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork. You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
2018-05-21,"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers &amp; beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar.com. Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs. Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare. Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as “facts” by Reveal. Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round. With production, 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live. About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it."
2018-05-22,"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM &amp; Chrysler to bankruptcy &amp; lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over &amp; now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry &amp; everyone knows it. We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X &amp; 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen? More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, &amp; they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler &amp; GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article … Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing! Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you. Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars. To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production. Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise &amp; many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production. Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car. Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp &amp; trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try. The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this. Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance &amp; others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out &amp; address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
2018-05-23,"I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived &amp; gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote. It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla &amp; millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real &amp; be a good company. We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue. Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks &amp; earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies &amp; gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers."
2018-05-24,"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world &amp; products that haven’t been unveiled yet. You don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches. Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like &amp; what needs to be improved But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right. Hi Kara! I’m open to it. Right now, I’m cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
2018-05-25,"Model 3 was designed for min engineering &amp; tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe &amp; Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year. This is the new production line for battery module Zone 4. Will play a key role in getting from 3000/week to 6000/week for Model 3. Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year &amp; is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in 2015 when we were just figuring things out. The Tesla facility is open plan &amp; we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well &amp; they are some of the worst &amp; best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former."
2018-05-26,"About to ship. holding flamethrower pickup parties in a week or so, then deliveries begin. Check for details. A Tesla has a usable reserve of 5 to 15 miles range even after the battery reads “empty”. This will not hurt the pack. I just sent a note to Tesla service to take care of your car right away &amp; our HVAC engineering lead to fix root cause Wow, amazing Tesla hypermile drive happening Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too. Can’t believe someone leaked this schematic of the Tesla production system!! Tesla will start extending the Supercharger network to South America around end of next year Global map of Tesla Superchargers, including those coming soon"
2018-05-27,"Yes, Model 3 Performance will have red calipers &amp; sport level brakes Will do another rev before final design Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model 3 started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks for excellent critical feedback!"
2018-05-28,"Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region Pointing out to aspiring journo &amp; Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by “powerful people” that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear."
2018-05-29,"Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions &amp; not lose money."
2018-05-30,"Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading &amp; point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair &amp; accurate in their criticism. Ride comfort &amp; aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there’s always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%. All items below will go to all Model 3s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say “bug report” followed by issue description. Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should. Braking &amp; UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise &amp; suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you’re really bothered by them, don’t replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort."
2018-05-31,Best analysis of Model 3 to date (German) Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.
2018-06-01,"Some details on the Tesla air filtration system Model 3 should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little 🥜 on S/X. Model S &amp; X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter &amp; a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model 3. Cool, Tesla S/X have hospital operating room air quality when BWD mode is activated, so shd protect against even a weaponized virus"
2018-06-02,"Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability. The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars."
2018-06-03,"Appreciated on behalf of Tesla team Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob won’t offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value. Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. It’s a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 week’s."
2018-06-06,"We are ramping production as fast as possible. Wait should be closer to 6 months though, not 2 years."
2018-06-07,"No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S &amp; X w HW2 Autopilot &amp; all Model 3 cars."
2018-06-08,We’re building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast &amp; excellent outcome Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model 3 Performance version. Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
2018-06-09,"19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 &amp; a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way… SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking &amp; cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly …"
2018-06-10,"Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust — literally bulletproof. Add an R for Roadster Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially. A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady. Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha. You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another. Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric. That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now &amp; fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features. That’s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents"
2018-06-12,"Difficult, but necessary Tesla reorg underway. My email to the company has already leaked to media. Here it is unfiltered:"
2018-06-13,We use less than 3% cobalt in our batteries &amp; will use none in next gen
2018-06-15,Already sold &gt;$100M TSLA for charity. Will do about that every few years. Major disbursements in about 20 years when Tesla is steady state.
2018-06-16,I disagree with that goal &amp; gave away Tesla patents to help other companies Amazing work by Tesla team. Built entire new general assembly line in 3 weeks w minimal resources. Love u guys so much! Pic of 1st Model 3 dual motor performance coming off the line …
2018-06-17,"We’ve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union &amp; Tesla stock. Also, free drinks &amp; snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla &amp; me via 3rd parties. ...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate. More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading). I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right. UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps. I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too. Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through &amp; through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that’s a special case. Auto-semiotic asphyxiation (sorry, couldn’t resist) The Semi-erotics of Evil “Profit” just means you earned more money than you spent &amp; certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing &amp; extremely hard. It has taken Tesla 15 years &amp; we’re almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford &amp; Tesla has gone bankrupt."
2018-06-18,"Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow &amp; nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW can’t even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer."
2018-06-19,"To be clear, Tesla European Headquarters will remain in Netherlands You’re probably right. Maybe after Tesla drama calms down. Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga &amp; spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack! Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much ♥️"
2018-06-20,"There is more, but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals. With 40,000 people, the worst 1 in 1000 will have issues. That’s still ~40 people. Thanks for coming by our car factory with . Tesla team was super fired up to see you! Congrats on your victory!!"
2018-06-22,"At Fremont until late tonight, Giga tomorrow, Fremont Sunday. GA4 is great, but have to say that GA3 crew is pulling off miracles against all odds. Was thinking of offering an extended Tesla factory tour option where you could help build part of a car &amp; understand how they come together. I know it would have been super fun for me when I was a kid (or now). It’s actually pretty fun building electric cars. Product is useful to other people &amp; good for environment. I think that’s fundamental goodness."

2018-06-25,"This doesn’t take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla. Critical autonomous safety features like emergency braking are standard, but convenience features like active cruise control are not It’s a tough call. Reality is that it will be pretty easy to bully a self-driving car, as it will always yield. Will prob have a manual override that requires continuous press for hardcore lane changes."
2018-06-26,"Wow, great idea! Since it will already have a Tesla pneumatics system, it totally makes sense to add a utility port. The Tesla Truck will have dual motor all-wheel drive w crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard. What would you love to see in a Tesla pickup truck? I have a few things in mind, but what do you think are small, but important nuances &amp; what would be seriously next level? “Virtue signaling” is super annoying &amp; there are lots of phoneys who are actually huge jerks, but jump on every social cause du jour. But I’m really proud of the fact that # of changes Tesla had to make to achieve 100/100 (before even knowing about the LGBTQ index) was zero. Then you will really hate that Tesla scored 100/100 four years in a row on LGBTQ equality"
2018-06-27,"No standard automotive solution could be built in time, so we created a new solution. It is working &amp; has slightly higher quality than the more traditional general assembly line. Perhaps most surprising is that the total cost of production in the Sprung tent is lower. All Tesla vehicles come with cabin overheat protection For sure! When doing US govt crash safety testing, the Model S roof was so strong, it broke their testing machine."

2018-07-05,"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so. Are you 100% certain that stands by &amp; supports everything she’s done? Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP? So publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism. . You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla? Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: , did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue? Sounds very sketchy if true. , is it possible you’re serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him &amp; he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true? Wow, so of wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production &amp; followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work &amp; . . is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target. has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &amp;3 production number, which is physically impossible."
2018-07-06,"Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed. Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."

My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment.
2018-08-08,Probably 4 to 6 months. Those who order full self-driving get the upgrade at no cost. It isn’t needed just for enhanced Autopilot. Tesla deliveries &amp; AP hardware chart by at MIT
2018-08-11,"Great Q&amp;A last night. Thanks for helping make Tesla &amp; SpaceX more secure! Planning to open-source Tesla vehicle security software for free use by other car makers. Extremely important to a safe self-driving future for all. Thanks, great feedback. Will be a fun project for Tesla design. Love the idea of adding a special item every few months, so whenever you go into a Tesla store, there is something new &amp; delightful to see. Production design will be better, especially in details. We are dying to do this, but primary focus must remain on making affordable version of Model 3 &amp; bringing Y to market Short shorts coming soon to Tesla merch"
2018-08-12,Model 3 traction testing on pure ice &amp; snow
2018-08-14,"I’m excited to work with Silver Lake and Goldman Sachs as financial advisors, plus Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz and Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson as legal advisors, on the proposal to take Tesla private"
2018-08-16,Model 3 review by Unbox ... via Missile Command &amp; Lunar Lander already working in dev build. We changed the control mapping for max fun on a touchscreen.
2018-08-18,Super appreciate free concert for Tesla during this intense time!
2018-08-19,Ford &amp; Tesla are the only 2 American car companies to avoid bankruptcy. I just got home from the factory. You think this is an option. It is not.
2018-08-24,"Tesla Car Karaoke hopefully ready in OTA software update version 10. Just played Missile Command, Asteroids &amp; Lunar Lander in V9. Really fun! Goal is to service your car wherever you are, quietly &amp; quickly. No need to bring it to a Tesla service center."
2018-08-25,"This is utterly false. Fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. Tesla Gigafactory will be 100% renewable powered (by Tesla Solar) by end of next year. Most major customers have tried it &amp; love it. Now we need to finish production design &amp; build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model 3 production system. Wish it wasn’t so hard to be less stupid over time … What’s cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles), using the existing Tesla Supercharger network and an extension cord In talking to our public investors, most were supportive of optimizing for long-term value creation over quarterly earnings. This was also a factor in remaining public."
2018-09-03,"Much appreciated! Great word-of-mouth is why Model 3 is the best-selling electric car, despite no advertising or paid endorsements."
2018-09-06,"Tesla 1st, 2nd &amp; 3rd in August sales"
2018-09-11,"Moving 2 of 7 Tesla colors off menu on Wednesday to simplify manufacturing. Obsidian Black &amp; Metallic Silver will still be available as special request, but at higher price."
2018-09-12,"Due to a large increase in vehicle delivery volume in North America, Tesla customers may experience longer response times. Resolving this is our top priority."
2018-09-14,"The Tesla board has done incredible work overseeing the largest value creation in the auto industry in 100+ years, despite many setbacks. Tesla owes its very existence to this board! Electric cars made with sunlight"
2018-09-15,Tesla owners can grant free Supercharging for life to a friend who buys S/3/X. Ends tomorrow night.
2018-09-16,"Yeah, that’s our problem. Service &amp; parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks. Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour. Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy Outside repair shops are jack of all trades, which means supporting 1000’s of makes &amp; models. Tesla collision repair specializes in three. Having all parts in stock &amp; not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference."
2018-09-17,"Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied &amp; this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now. Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night Sorry, we’ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. We’re making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly. Sorry, it’s not really sustainable at volume production &amp; doesn’t incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier."
2018-09-19,Tesla Rangers!
2018-09-20,"Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric. A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details . will post final safety probability stats soon. Model 3 has a shot at being safest car ever tested."
2018-09-22,"Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners who’d like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun &amp; morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!"
2018-09-25,♥️ Tesla Owners ♥️
2018-09-28,Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!! Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
2018-09-29,Tesla will deliver your car to you. This is the future. The way it should work.
2018-10-02,"Tesla Autopilot team is awesome! Got to make sure we iron out the details though. Long tail of tricky edge cases. Important to get front wide angle, B pillar &amp; side repeater camera neural nets just right."
2018-10-04,"By revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, Model 3 actually outsold Camry by a factor of two If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. Otherwise, buy."
2018-10-05,V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere. Tesla owners can refer someone to buy a Tesla &amp; get any image they want laser etched in glass &amp; sent to deep space for millions of years
2018-10-06,What city &amp; what Model 3 config?
2018-10-07,"Tesla owner shows how well ultrawhite seats hold up after 25,000 miles. The black &amp; white interior is def best imo."
2018-10-08,"The physics of how Tesla achieved best safety of any cars ever tested. Note, when vehicle weight is taken into account, order is more like X,S, then 3, but they are all very close."
2018-10-09,No such thing as a “full refresh” at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
2018-10-11,"Exactly. A Tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars, according to NHTSA’s *own* calculations. This is just physics!"
2018-10-12,"Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you. Teslaquila coming soon …"
2018-10-13,Whole beer keg fits in Model 3 trunk!
2018-10-14,"Thanks for recognizing the great work of the Tesla team! 45,000 people now."
2018-10-15,"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude. Model 3 motor &amp; gearbox still in good condition after driving 1M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance. Haha. It is actually my fav game on Tesla cars right now What are some of the most fun games we could have on a Tesla? Classic Atari is just the start."
2018-10-16,The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
2018-10-17,"New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months &amp; all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time. Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America &amp; realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months."
2018-10-18,"Model 3 long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so It’s kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see. Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow &amp; ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires. It’s a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model 3 &amp; super simple new order page"
2018-10-19,"If you don’t like a Tesla for any reason or no reason, you can just give it back for a full refund"
2018-10-22,"Order Tesla without test drive &amp; you get 3 days to return for refund, else 1 day"
2018-10-23,"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week. To simplify production, many Tesla Model S &amp; X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want. Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldn’t look like a radiator grill opening."
2018-10-25,"Love Tesla supporters so much!!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ ♥️ ♥️♥️♥️ ♥️ ♥️♥️ ♥️ ♥️ ♥️ ♥️ Model 3 was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements &amp; no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model 3 was product alone. Massive thanks to Tesla owners &amp; supporters. We wouldn’t be here without you."
2018-10-26,"S is better, but rear seat folds down in Model 3, so bikes can fit in trunk Taking action. Tesla body shops now operating in California aiming for same day body repair in most cases."
2018-10-27,"Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging. It’s a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action … Exactly, this is total bs. What part of “production hell” sounds like a sure thing!? Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer Didn’t you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don’t get that. Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm. Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal. You’re right. Earlier Model 3 Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently. It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund &amp; free Supercharging turned off, we will do that."
2018-10-29,Deleted my Tesla titles last week to see what would happen. I’m now the Nothing of Tesla. Seems fine so far.
2018-10-31,"For those unfamiliar, this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm it’s valid &amp; park."
2018-11-01,"r wrong, but in 🧠 Tesla makes s 4 overseas &amp; East Coast in 1st half of quarter We can make it work from very far away. LoS is just for safety. Car will drive to your phone location &amp; follow you like a pet if you hold down summon button on Tesla app Tesla advanced Summon ready in ~6 weeks! Just an over-the-air software upgrade, so will work on all cars made in past 2 years (Autopilot hardware V2+)."
2018-11-02,"To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible. Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner. Amazing results by at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!"
2018-11-07,"No, we’re building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
2018-11-09,"Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety. Please lmk what you’d most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks! With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster"
2018-11-10,"Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3. If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
2018-11-14,Would be fun to add to Tesla
2018-11-15,"Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location. Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30"
2018-11-17,"It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level Set air flow to recirculating mode &amp; manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times."
2018-11-19,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets. No, it’s got enough load capacity &amp; volume to carry the battery pack &amp; our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered. In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts &amp; processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output. Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler &amp; produce sooner or do all &amp; produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster. Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not. Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner Will allow having your car picked up &amp; dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps"
2018-11-23,"If you don’t want a Tesla, here’s a list of all electric cars in North America via"
2018-11-28,"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive."
2018-11-29,"After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor &amp; more video games. You can summon your Tesla from your phone. Only short distances today, but in a few years summon will work from across the continent."
2018-11-30,Your Tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time
2018-12-01,"Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving. Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth. As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
2018-12-03,"We’re adding police car, fire truck &amp; ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there’s no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop &amp; turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."
2018-12-05,"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump &amp; lines."
2018-12-07,Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars &amp; ground to tunnel car elevators.
2018-12-09,"Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability. Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all. If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars &amp; takes highway interchanges &amp; off-ramps. It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car. Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later. Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe &amp; later China. Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later."
2018-12-11,"Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific, not executive role, which means it’s not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut “provided I have the support of shareholders”. Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked) Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks. To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year. Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don’t believe in climate change. Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be. You’re right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with tell a more interesting story. We’re opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
2018-12-15,"In other words, you may be able to get a Tesla before the $7500 US tax credit drops in 2 weeks, even if you haven’t placed an order yet"
2018-12-16,Tesla app almost done. Important to get every note right!
2018-12-18,Honored to work with amazing teams at SpaceX &amp; Tesla!
2018-12-19,"Autopilot doesn’t need the guide wheels. They’re only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future. Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument. A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety. This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla Tesla in tunnel with retractable wheel gear that turns a car into a rail-guided train &amp; back again"
2018-12-20,"Tesla phone app release next week will enable service scheduling in 2 mins with a few taps. No more need to call! As a thank you to Tesla short sellers, we named a after them haha"
2018-12-22,"Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars. If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can’t take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less. Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in 8 days. Order online at or visit stores."
2018-12-26,"Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers, all the way to Brownsville &amp; across Mexico. Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey. Most people don’t know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities &amp; working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car. Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter! If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options: And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements. Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in 5 days! Order online at to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores."

2019-02-21,"Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun."
2019-02-26,"Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It’s 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder. SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing … 🤗"
2019-02-27,Some Tesla news
2019-02-28,"Everyone who bought Enhanced Autopilot will get Navigate on Autopilot on highways, advanced summon &amp; autopark"
2019-03-01,"Explanation from Tesla later today Best choice for most people is standard range plus with Autopilot Exact Tesla Model 3 in my profile pic costs $35k before incentives &amp; takes 1 minute to buy online at Base Model 3 available in Europe in ~6 months, Asia 6 to 8 months. Latter contingent on Shanghai Gigafactory. Country-specific taxes &amp; import duties mean price may be 25% or more above US number."
2019-03-02,"If you bought enhanced autopilot, FSD upgrade costs $2k instead of $5k If you bought a Tesla before yesterday’s price reduction, you can have Autopilot or full self-driving at half normal cost (up to $6k less)"
2019-03-03,"Yes. Personally, I’m most excited by the Tesla Truck. Maybe it will be too futuristic for most people, but I love it. Model Y, being an SUV, is about 10% bigger than Model 3, so will cost about 10% more &amp; have slightly less range for same battery Model Y unveil event on March 14 at LA Design Studio First public Tesla V3.0 Supercharger Station goes live Wed 8pm Model S will be raised to 162mph too"
2019-03-04,"Gap in understanding is that $35k Model 3 production *starts* this month, but will not reach volume production until mid year. Extremely difficult to predict middle part of manufacturing S-curve."
2019-03-05,Tesla comms is fixing. That was a mistake.
2019-03-07,"Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays &amp; updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%. Very little power &amp; only right before you get to the Supercharger. You won’t notice it in range. You’re most welcome. Very proud of Tesla team. Super tough 15 years! Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput. If you navigate to Supercharger, car will warm up battery en route, so you start immediately at max power"
2019-03-09,"For cargo missions, propulsive land landing should be no problem. Doesn’t have same safety criticality as crew. Dragon 2 was designed to land using thrusters, with parachutes as backup. Switched to chutes as primary, due to difficulty of proving safety, but Dragon can still do it."
2019-03-12,"When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don’t want to write Tesla a check. So it goes. Tesla car prices go up ~3% next week, except for $35k Model 3. Order online at before then for current prices."
2019-03-14,Worth watching Revenge of the Electric Car. Covers rebirth of electric cars in general. Has footage before &amp; after we started production of our first car.
2019-03-15,London to Beijing Supercharger route
2019-03-16,"To be clear, orders are fully refundable, even after you’ve had your Tesla for a week This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don’t actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules. Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that’s a lot of complexity. Still get this question a lot, even though Norway has highest Tesla cars per person on (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice. About a minute in, we flashed a teaser pic of Tesla cyberpunk truck End Titles from Blade Runner played after Model Y webcast cut"

2019-03-26,"Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it Glad you like it! Navigate on Autopilot hopefully approved for Europe soon. Ford has 4 CEOs in 5 years &amp; nobody blinks, but Tesla loses 1 intern &amp; it’s front page news. I tell ya (shakes fist at sky) …"
2019-03-27,Super proud of Tesla Autopilot team!
2019-03-28,"Rare use case, but it is possible. There are complications with this. Eary prototype Roadsters had this ability."
2019-03-29,"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important."
2019-03-30,"We’ve been so mired in production &amp; logistics for past 18 months. Really looking fwd to getting Semi into production. Amazing work by Tesla Delivery teams, especially in Europe &amp; China! Most insane logistics challenge I’ve ever seen. Thanks also to many country &amp; city officials for your help this weekend! Super appreciated. Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2. Anyone who bought FSD will get it Tesla Semi delivering Tesla cars"
2019-04-01,"Going forward, all Tesla stores will be tiny &amp; have tiny cars"
2019-04-04,"Totally agree. Tesla phone app should have all controls that car center screen has, so your phone can serve as a complete backup."
2019-04-05,"“…drivers in this dataset use Autopilot for 34.8% of their driven miles, and yet appear to maintain a relatively high degree of functional vigilance.” Yes, instead of someone needing to drive their car personally, they can manage a fleet of self-driving cars That’s exactly the idea. What’s not well understood is that Tesla cars being made *today* will be able to do that for you. Just a matter of finishing the software &amp; going through regulatory approval. Will be explained in depth via live webcast on April 22. It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft &amp; people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video."
2019-04-06,Tesla Enhanced Summon coming out in US next week for anyone with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option Latest Autopilot update is epic. Rolling out to all US owners with Enhanced Autopilot or Full Self-Driving option. International coming soon.
2019-04-07,It will enable video when parked &amp; connected to WiFi. All Tesla Superchargers will have free WiFi over time.
2019-04-08,"Doesn’t matter yet whether you have Tesla FSD computer or Tesla Nvidia-based computer. When it does matter later this year, Tesla will switch the computers for you. The Tesla Full Self-Driving Computer now in production is at about 5% compute load for these tasks or 10% with full fail-over redundancy"
2019-04-12,"Other automakers change prices constantly &amp; substantially by varying rebates &amp; discounts according to negotiating strength of buyer. Tesla is transparent &amp; consistent. So if we raise prices in the future, will you cut Tesla a check? Can’t have it both ways. LHD order page should be live within a few weeks. Deliveries start hopefully June/July. Leasing now available for Model 3"
2019-04-13,"Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical. Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time Lease a Tesla online in a few mins &amp; have it delivered to your house (return within 7 days for full refund) Model 3 drive unit &amp; body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last 300k to 500k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k. On April 22, Investor Autonomy Day, Tesla will free investors from the tyranny of having to drive their own car"
2019-04-14,"That tweet did take immense effort 🤣🤣 Fair point tho. Powerwall production is now ramping fast. Tesla was cell-starved last year, so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars, which meant Powerwall production was living off scraps. I’ve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy I’m sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can’t *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ exposé pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they’re all angels … Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that’s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply. Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn’t have access to the video unless sent to us by owner. Wow, a lot of people don’t know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve. There is 35 GWh/yr “theoretical capacity”, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3’s in Q1 due to cell constraints."
2019-04-15,Buying a car in 2019 that can’t upgrade to full self-driving is like buying a horse instead of a car in 1919
2019-04-16,"Yeah, gave everything I had to Tesla in Dec 2008 It’s not a big deal. Charge to 90% to 95% &amp; you’ll be fine. At 100% state of charge, regen braking doesn’t work, because the battery is full, so car is less energy efficient."
2019-04-19,"Put water repellant coating on radar, dark rectangle just below nose. Anything hydrophobic from hardware store or Tesla service can do it."
2019-04-21,"Never seen anything like it. Tesla is just trying to make electric cars &amp; solar power for a better future for all. True, we might not succeed, but why do they want us to fail?"
2019-04-22,Actual Tesla range is about 5 miles / 8 km past zero
2019-04-23,"We can probably just repurpose Model 3 HVAC parts. Not a big deal. Long lasting battery + fast recharge &gt; pack swap Tesla is going to develop a quiet, electric leafblower Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez … Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV’s have high fire risk when opposite is true. When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there’s a good reason that isn’t obvious. Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned? Over a million combustion engine (it’s right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question. Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard? Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between 10 years &amp; never … Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) &amp; we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year. As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost &amp; larger range pack needed. Anyone who did this analysis should interview at Tesla Full Self-Driving video All Model 3’s ever made can upgrade All cars made since Oct 2016 either have the hardware needed for FSD or are trivially upgradeable Tesla Full Self-Driving"
2019-04-24,"Agreed, we’re ramping up service centers &amp; Tesla mobile service worldwide As mentioned before, Tesla full self-driving option price will increase after May 1.

2019-05-18,"No worse than production of a gasoline car, provided the lithium-ion battery cathode is primarily nickel vs cobalt. Nickel is the main alloying ingredient in stainless steel, which is what knives &amp; forks are made of. Because a Tesla produces no emissions &amp; filters most toxins, pollen, spores &amp; viruses, it actually cleans up surrounding air as it travels"

Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year. Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts.

2019-06-30,"FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years."
2019-07-02,Congratulations Tesla team &amp; thanks to all the new Tesla owners!! ♥️♥️
2019-07-03,"Active safety will continue to improve via over-the-air software updates. Since all Tesla cars are connected, we analyze each accident &amp; do our best to minimize probability of recurrence. Best crash safety system is not crashing in the first place. Makes a world of difference for pedestrians &amp; cyclists especially. Reason for top rating is that active steering &amp; braking safety features of Tesla Autopilot are turned on no cost for all cars"
2019-07-06,Model X as it should be shown
2019-07-08,"To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car Intersections with complex traffic lights &amp; shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety. Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4, as it’s limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies. This is why it’s possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k &amp; make at least ~500k FSD cars All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer &amp; all production in past few months has FSD computer"
2019-07-09,"Would be cool if car took you to a random fun place traveled to by other Tesla owners in the area There is no “refreshed” Model X or Model S coming, only a series of minor ongoing changes. Most significant change in past few years was to use high efficiency Model 3 rear drive unit as S/X front drive unit. That went into production 3 months ago."

2019-07-16,"As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit. Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team. Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16 Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them &amp; we won’t be able to. No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week"
2019-07-17,"Agreed, should be $3k less to get to FSD from EAP"
2019-07-18,"No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot Exactly. Trendline that includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features matches curve of Autopilot software/hardware releases, as you’d expect. This non-Autopilot graph is not correct, as it includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features I mostly drive Model S Performance with dev version of FSD computer.

2019-08-04,Lyft/Uber/taxi drivers are expert Tesla advocates. Thanks for your support!!
2019-08-08,"We’re working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesn’t quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world. Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident. Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff …"

World’s first very large scale battery has worked out well If you’re a utility or public utilities commission, please consider using the Tesla Megapack. Better for the environment &amp; usually lower cost than fossil fuel peaker plants! Tesla is working hard to help stop global warming"
2019-09-03,"Try Tesla Insurance. Should be ~20% less than avg. Currently only in California, but expanding soon. Critical feedback much appreciated."
2019-09-05,Model S on Nürburgring next week
2019-09-07,"Without the removal fee, Tesla Solar is unequivocally a guaranteed, instant money printer, producing $300 to $1000 per year (in after tax income!) For the remainder of September, Tesla is permanently waiving the $1500 solar removal fee requirement. Note, the ability to stop monthly payments at any time remains. Wanted to build an electric car company in college. Was going to do PhD at Stanford in electric energy storage (ultracaps), but got distracted for a few years by the Internet. Tesla doing laps at Nerdburgering"
2019-09-11,"But we probably won’t try for best lap time this week, as we need to review &amp; tune Model S thoroughly for safety on Nürburgring, especially Flugplatz section Model S is already there Model S just set record for fastest 4 door ever at Laguna Seca, video tmrw"
2019-09-12,"Autopilot active crash prevention keeps getting better, as we examine every crash for improvement &amp; then upload smarter software. Ironically, I hope we’re never on the list! Yes. To be clear, Plaid powertrain is about a year away from production &amp; applies to S,X &amp; Roadster, but not 3 or Y. Will cost more than our current offerings, but less than competitors. Model S at Nürburgring has 7 seats"
2019-09-13,Tesla commercial solar ordering now live at
2019-09-14,"However, we won’t customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense. Exactly! We’ve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide. That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval. There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all. Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."
2019-09-15,Thanks Tesla owners. You rock!! ♥️♥️
2019-09-16,"Feeling Lucky (Google tribute!) or Hungry are 100% intended for max enjoyment of Tesla owner. If location has destination chargers, that’s a plus, but car should only route there if location is great. This will be hit &amp; miss initially, but should hone towards excellent over time."
2019-09-17,"Actually, Model 3 would beat the Taycan on Nürburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range Rear facing, but roomier. Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys &amp; Talulah in the 7 seat Model S several years ago. New Roadster and X will come later It’s a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year."
2019-09-22,"Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom."
2019-09-23,"Hoping to open in Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia &amp; most of Eastern Europe early next year. Finally, we will do Nikola Tesla proud by having his cars in his countries of origin! OG Roadster is def helping us out here with 826M miles by itself"
2019-09-24,"It would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-Tesla battery! Tesla is building a major engineering team in China, incl heavy focus on software/firmware for factory &amp; car Many powerful electric motors &amp; batteries. Force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. More about this on the 28th."
2019-09-26,Tesla V10.0 just started rolling out to all US Tesla owners with FSD option &amp; “advanced download” selected in vehicle software settings
2019-09-27,"No, we’ve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have &amp; we’ll get around to it, but not needed for flight."
2019-09-30,"Probably our most viral feature ever. Most of the Autopilot team has been working on this, led by Ashok, CJ, Andrej &amp; many others."
2019-10-01,"Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see"
2019-10-02,"Over 550,000 Tesla Smart Summon uses in first few days! Thanks, Tesla team is the strongest it’s ever been &amp; doing an amazing job! Honored to work beside them."
2019-10-06,"Customized horn &amp; movement sounds (coconuts being one, of course) coming to Teslas soon"
2019-10-08,"We had to reallocate some resources to speed this up &amp; received great support from Airborne, our parachute supplier. I was at their Irvine factory with the SpaceX team on Sat and Sun. We’re focusing on the advanced Mk3 chute, which provides highest safety factor for astronauts."
2019-10-09,We’re changing Powerwall Storm Watch to Disaster Watch. Covers more bases. Tesla software V10.0 comes with karaoke
2019-10-10,Fundamental metric of good of Tesla is how many years sooner it brings the advent of a sustainable energy future Also adding Tesla Solar to our Supercharger stations as fast as possible. Goal is 24/7 clean power with no blackouts. All Tesla Supercharger stations in regions affected by California power outages will have Tesla Powerpacks within next few weeks. Just waiting on permits.
2019-10-12,"Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date. Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist. When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car. Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released. Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1 Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power &amp; no more blackouts! V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout."
2019-10-14,"It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when &amp; how fast to move the wipers. Deep Rain™️ neural net coming soon. We’re not trademarking any other Autopilot neural nets, just this one, because rain is deep. Cybertruck doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen bouncing around the Internet. It’s closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future."
2019-10-15,"Anyone who’s interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing — designing &amp; building the machine that makes the machine — please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We’re gonna take this to a whole new level! Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe. Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit. Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard"
2019-10-16,"Tesla wins best headlights award 🥇 The final configuration used at Nürburgring to set the record will go into production around summer 2020, so this is not merely for the track"
2019-10-21,"Very likely that a home with clean power that’s lower cost than utility, plus blackout protection via Powerwall, will have a positive effect on value Order Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power &amp; no blackouts!"
2019-10-23,Super proud of Tesla team for great execution &amp; support of Tesla customers greatly appreciated!! Tesla Q3 results: - Shanghai Giga ahead of schedule - Model Y ahead of schedule - Solar installs +48% from Q2 - GAAP profitable - Positive free cash flow The big rear wing is only on for one day for rear downforce calibration. Isn’t needed to set ring record &amp; won’t be in the production car.
2019-10-24,Tesla Solar Tile Roof V3 launch tomorrow at 2pm
2019-10-25,"Tesla Solarglass roof Maybe call Tesla solar roof tiles product Solarglass? Like Dragonglass, but solar!"
2019-10-26,"Yes, you can walk on the Tesla Solarglass roof. In stilettos, if you want Jerome is great! Tesla team in general is the strongest its ever been."
2019-10-27,Thanks to everyone at Tesla who worked so hard over the years to make our Fremont factory successful!
2019-10-28,"Unfortunately, it’s hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to to add solar to an existing roof &amp; for a new roof with integrated solar. If you’re directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important. I’d recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery backup for 24/7 clean energy &amp; no blackouts at"
2019-10-30,Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem! That’s significantly improved in current production Just a reminder that the Tesla Full Self-Driving option goes up by $1000 at midnight on Nov 1 for all regions that have Smart Summon. Order your car online at
2019-10-31,"Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there’s a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 &amp; 1/4 mile races."
2019-11-01,"Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called “Low Gear”! Tesla Solarglass vs Happy Halloween!!"
2019-11-05,"Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software. Fair point. Coming soon. We’re making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that."
2019-11-06,Cybertruck unveil on Nov 21 in LA near SpaceX rocket factory This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “Pitch Day” &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don’t buy APCs. It’s the Air Force.
2019-11-08,"SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."
2019-11-12,"Will build batteries, powertrains &amp; vehicles, starting with Model Y ♥️ GIGA BERLIN ♥️"
2019-11-13,Congrats to Tesla team on Model 3 winning best midsize car in Germany!
2019-11-14,Semi-infinite
2019-11-16,Cybertruck unveil Thursday night
2019-11-18,"I’d be way too embarrassed to put that on a Tesla. It’s like a kid’s drawing. Congratulations on the Mach E! Sustainable/electric cars are the future!! Excited to see this announcement from Ford, as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too."
2019-11-20,"So many reporters gave Chanos airtime when he called Tesla a worthless fraud. Now that he has been proven wrong, silence …"
2019-11-21,Coming soon! We’re working to complete the full Supercharger route from London to Shanghai. Tesla Cybertruck (pressurized edition) will be official truck of Mars Cybertruck design influenced partly by The Spy Who Loved Me
2019-11-22,"Better truck than an F-150, faster than a Porsche 911. Order Cybertruck online at Tesla 2 person electric ATV will come at first as an option for Cybertruck Nobody *expects* the Cybertruck High time we had a Tesla coil!"
2019-11-23,"146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor Riding in the Cybertruck Franz throws steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch. Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha."
2019-11-24,"Cybertruck pulls F-150 uphill In general, this is something Tesla should do Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too We’re creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we’ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can’t be made using standard methods. Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger. Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press"
2019-11-25,Cybertruck is inspired by games like Halo. Warthog irl!!
2019-11-27,"Yes, Cybertruck will have steel balls 🤣🤣"
2019-12-01,"Tesla was almost called Faraday, as original holder of Tesla Motors trademark refused to sell it to us! That’s why Cybertruck has active suspension height &amp; damping control Safety work is done by engineering, with passive safety by body/chassis eng &amp; active by Autopilot. Design in automotive refers to look &amp; feel. With extreme effort, Cybertruck might hit a 0.30 drag coefficient, which would be insane for a truck. Requires tweaking many small details."
2019-12-07,"He’s def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs Super strong roof that generates clean energy, looks great &amp; costs less than a normal roof plus solar panels! Huge admiration &amp; respect for the Tesla China team. Their talent &amp; drive is amazing! Huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to Cybertruck. It’s better because of you! ♥️♥️♥️"
2019-12-08,"We’ll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won’t do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when I was 17."
2019-12-18,MCU (infotainment computer) upgrade not recommended imo. Isn’t needed for full self-driving &amp; cost is ~$2k for limited entertainment improvements.
2019-12-19,"This is quite a thorny hardware problem, as there are many diff versions of mcu &amp; autopilot computer &amp; supporting hardware. Cars last so much longer than phones! Hopefully able to upgrade mcu1 &amp; ap2.0 in a few months. Tesla Moth Mode (better late than never)"
2019-12-20,"Tesla holiday software update has FSD sneak preview, Stardew Valley, Lost Backgammon &amp; a few other things"
2019-12-21,We’re working on moving more cars to Florida. End of year delivery is intense! Very proud of Tesla team for all their hard work.
2019-12-22,"Started Zip2 with ~$2k &amp; ~$100k of student debt, rolled proceeds into X/PayPal, rolled proceeds again into SpaceX/Tesla, but these are all companies where I played fundamental founding role. Not right to ask others to put in money if I don’t put in mine. If Tesla &amp; SpaceX go bankrupt, so will I. As it should be. That’s certainly our impression, but it’s an old version of Tesla software, so effect is limited"
2019-12-26,"The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve We’re building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production. Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar If you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?"
2019-12-27,Was up all night with SpaceX team working on Starship tank dome production (most difficult part of primary structure). Dawn arrives …
2019-12-29,Sorry about this. We will do our best. The Tesla production &amp; delivery teams have been working super hard.
2019-12-30,"Building prototypes is relatively easy, volume production is hard Headed to Tesla Fremont factory tomorrow to help with vehicle deliveries Yeah, engineering is ~90% of my time at SpaceX &amp; about ~60% at Tesla Direct drive using several Tesla Plaid motors in parallel for SN1. Simpler, lighter &amp; more fault tolerant. Rear flaps each need ~1.5 megawatts. It’s like moving the entire wing of an aircraft! Tesla merch def needs some love, but too many fish to fry rn Tesla uses that to wirebond cells to module current collectors. Is there a commercially available machine that can weld ~4mm full hard 301 stainless barrels &amp; domes? Crew Dragon is capable of propulsive landing, but would require extensive testing to prove safety. Better to focus on Starship. Crew Dragon should be physically ready &amp; at the Cape in Feb, but completing all safety reviews will probably take a few more months Amazing work by Tesla China team!! ❤️❤️ Tesla app based payment will soon be rolled out WW. It’s tough making functionality work across so many regulatory domains. Is purchasing through the Tesla app not working? Renewable energy production (solar, wind, geothermal), improving home insulation &amp; electric transport will do the trick. Vegan/vegetarian helps a little, but isn’t critical. We should take the set of actions that maximize total public happiness!"
2019-12-31,Thanks all Tesla club members for helping out! Looking forward to seeing you there tomorrow. ❤️
2020-01-01,Congratulations Tesla &amp; SpaceX on great 2019! You rock!! Looking forward to epic 2020 ♥️☀️
2020-01-07,At Tesla Giga Shanghai NSFW!!
2020-01-08,♥️♥️ Tesla China Team ♥️♥️ Such amazing progress!!
2020-01-10,"Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts &amp; better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight."
2020-01-12,Teslas will soon talk to people if you want. This is real.
2020-01-15,Just saw this today. Tesla refunds in general should be easy to get electronically &amp; certainly through customer service. Will he addressed.
2020-01-17,"Munro’s analysis of Tesla engineering is accurate, both pro &amp; con. I think he will appreciate some elements of the Model Y body design. Yeah. A lot of work is needed for propellant production on Mars."
2020-01-21,"Would like to take a moment to thank Michael &amp; Ze’ev for helping Tesla. It was very hard work &amp; both could’ve just rested on their laurels. Much appreciated . Michael Marks, then Ze’ev Drori, but I helped out as co-CEO as they didn’t have much automotive domain expertise"
2020-01-22,"Want to play The Witcher game on your Tesla? (you can already watch the show on Tesla Netflix theater) Yeah, we just finished two more propellant domes. SpaceX team &amp; supporting suppliers are doing amazing work ramping Starship production."
2020-01-24,V3 Supercharger deployment will accelerate considerably this year
2020-01-25,"A Tesla works as a boat for short periods of time, as an electric car has no air intake or exhaust to block &amp; battery/motor/electronics are water-sealed. Submarines are just underwater EVs. Going with nomenclature of Giga [most widely understood location name] vs Giga so Giga Shanghai, Giga Nevada, Giga New York &amp; Giga Berlin For sure. Giga Berlin will build sustainable energy vehicles using sustainable energy, so net environmental impact will be extremely positive! Giga Berlin / GF4 will absolutely be designed with sustainability and the environment in mind Sounds like we need to clear up a few things! Tesla won’t use this much net water on a daily basis. It’s possibly a rare peak usage case, but not an everyday event. Also, this is not a natural forest — it was planted for use as cardboard &amp; only a small part will be used for GF4."
2020-01-29,A friend just sent me this excerpt from a Tesla blog I wrote 14 years ago
2020-01-30,"Exactly. Mars propellant production will combine atmospheric CO2 &amp; water (ice) to make CH4 (methane) &amp; O2. Will do same on Earth long-term. Short-term, each Falcon flight uses roughly same fuel mass as a 747 flight. Falcon is ~71% oxygen &amp; Starship is ~78%, so mostly not fuel."
2020-02-02,"Tesla will hold a super fun AI party/hackathon at my house with the Tesla AI/autopilot team in about four weeks. Invitations going out soon. Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable &amp; optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors &amp; compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with “At Tesla, using AI to solve self-driving isn’t just icing on the cake, it the cake” - Join AI at Tesla! It reports directly to me &amp; we meet/email/text almost every day. My actions, not just words, show how critically I view (benign) AI."
2020-02-03,"First, we need to make it super safe &amp; easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production &amp; implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards. Ok sure Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn’t be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory."
2020-02-04,"This is mainly for staffing up 4 production shifts for 24/7 operations, but engineers, supervisors &amp; support personnel are certainly needed too. A super hardcore work ethic, talent for building things, common sense &amp; trustworthiness are required, the rest we can train. Going max hardcore on design/production Starship here in Boca. It’s awesome! Feels a bit like a Mars simulator."
2020-02-05,Giga Texas?
2020-02-07,"That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume."
2020-02-09,"Hard to believe that is high efficiency solar power seamlessly integrated into beautiful roof tiles. Great work by SolarGlass engineering, Giga NY factory &amp; Tesla installation teams!"
2020-02-10,"No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it’s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles. This is incorrect. No air suspension planned for 3/Y. Only S/X &amp; Cybertruck have/will have air suspension. Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory, where we make SolarGlass &amp; several other products. Will also offer customer &amp; media tours. Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice. Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there! Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated. Your comment above: “Who in their right mind would buy an ICE after 2025 knowing its residual value will be zilch? Legacy auto: go EV or go BUST!” is super important for car buyers. Residual values for gas/diesel cars will plummet in coming years."
2020-02-15,Tesla Model S estimated EPA range is now above 390 miles or ~630 km
2020-02-16,"Tesla is ramping up Solar Roof installation across the USA! Training will be provided, so no prior experience needed. Apply at"
2020-02-17,"All orgs developing advanced AI should be regulated, including Tesla I have no control &amp; only very limited insight into OpenAI. Confidence in Dario for safety is not high."
2020-02-19,Rocket nosecone production in Texas
2020-02-20,F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year! Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.
2020-02-21,"Btw, in some prior tweets I’d said production Cybertruck would be ~80” wide (vs ~84” body width at unveil). This is slightly too small. Will be closer to 82”, but come standard with upper laser blade lights."
2020-02-22,Getting there was super hard. Very proud of Tesla team! Model 3 achieves 350 mile actual range vs 310 EPA sticker in Consumer Reports testing
2020-02-25,Teslas in a tunnel. Happening in Vegas rn.
2020-03-02,"We need to finish work on Autopilot core foundation code &amp; 3D labelling, then functionality will happen quickly. Not long now."
2020-03-03,"No matter what, we need to pressurize the production system. Rocket design is relatively easy, making one is hard, making many is extremely hard. Manufacturing is underrated."
2020-03-04,"Cool, we’re tracking to release more FSD features later this month True. Oddly, those who complained didn’t actually order FSD. Perhaps they weren’t aware that the computer is upgraded for free if the FSD option is ordered even after delivery."
2020-03-09,"Static fire &amp; short flights with SN3, longer flights with SN4, but spooling up the whole Starship/Raptor production line is really what matters"
2020-03-10,"Tesla should have a mega rave cave under the Berlin Gigafatory Congratulations Tesla team on making our 1,000,000th car!!"
2020-03-11,Model Y production for east coast too Scouting locations for Cybertruck Gigafactory. Will be central USA.
2020-03-14,Once production has exceeded preorders
2020-03-15,Congratulations Giga NY team!
2020-03-19,"Tesla makes cars with sophisticated hvac systems. SpaceX makes spacecraft with life support systems. Ventilators are not difficult, but cannot be produced instantly. Which hospitals have these shortages you speak of right now? China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers &amp; all of Tesla Shanghai"
2020-03-22,Supply chain logistics — getting masks &amp; other PPE to the right places in time — is the main issue we’re hearing from ER physicians
2020-03-23,Model Y heat pump is some of the best engineering I’ve seen in a while. Team did next-level work.
2020-03-24,"Thanks Tesla China team, China Customs Authority &amp; LAX customs for acting so swiftly"
2020-03-25,Giga New York will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible. We will do anything in our power to help the citizens of New York.
2020-03-27,"Biggest value Tesla is providing is precise delivery of ventilators exactly to the ICU where &amp; when they’re needed. There are many ventilators in warehouses, but stuck in logistics/routing/paperwork issues. You’re most welcome. Credit to the Tesla team. Will do our best to help in any way."
2020-03-31,"We have extra FDA-approved ventilators. Will ship to hospitals worldwide within Tesla delivery regions. Device &amp; shipping cost are free. Only requirement is that the vents are needed immediately for patients, not stored in a warehouse. Please me or know."
2020-04-03,"Oh sure, good point. Will discuss with team &amp; make available to buy in Tesla app."
2020-04-04,Tesla is on second rev of internal ventilator design. Will post an update on this tomorrow. First Medtronic units from Tesla getting installed in NY metro area. These are for worst case situations.
2020-04-05,We’re adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!
2020-04-08,"Humans drive using 2 cameras on a slow gimbal &amp; are often distracted. A Tesla with 8 cameras, radar, sonar &amp; always being alert can definitely be superhuman."
2020-04-09,Plaid Cybertruck is what I will drive In about a year. Would come from Giga Berlin.
2020-04-13,"There’s a lot to talk about just on the battery front, so, yeah, just that. I guess we could answer some powertrain questions in Q&amp;A. Just battery day, but it will be great. Plaid powertrain will be later this year."
2020-04-14,"Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y Giga Berlin will have world’s most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature"
2020-04-16,"Partial list of hospitals to which Tesla sent ventilators We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights &amp; stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year. Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet … I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage. Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated! Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!"
2020-04-20,"Yeah, and whole lot more! Aargh, I’m dying to make Cybertruck like yesterday!!"
2020-04-22,Solar panel angle during orbit raise / park. We’re fixing it now. Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle &amp; all sats get sunshades starting with launch 9.
2020-04-23,"Maybe Cybertruck will have it … Side camera view looks a little weird, as meant for self-driving, but will review with team. Image will need a little post-processing. In advance of this, please try to hack Starlink &amp; Tesla Mothership!"
2020-04-24,Welcome to the Tesla board! Honored to have you.
2020-04-25,"That basically describes SoC 0 vs SoC 1 of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change! Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time &amp; reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production. As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is &gt;1000% harder than designing it Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term. Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame &amp; actuation. Not saying new Giga will be in Texas, but Cybertruck will be produced there wherever it is, as Fremont is at max capacity"
2020-05-01,"As always, I am optimistic about Tesla long-term Tesla stock price is too high imo"
2020-05-03,Anyone think they can get a good multiplayer Minecraft working on Teslas? Or maybe create a game that interacts virtually with reality like Pokémon Go while driving safely? Like a complex version of Pac-man or Mario Kart?
2020-05-04,"Anyway, we’re just talking about 2% here, so not much. Confident Model S will get 400+ miles as soon as retest is allowed."
2020-05-07,"Tesla &amp; SpaceX are the top two destinations for engineers, because you can have the most fun creating kickass technology! That’s why."
2020-05-08,Teslas automatically maintain their internal temperature to within safe limits in case a pet or child is left in the car
2020-05-09,"Tesla is the biggest manufacturer in California &amp; second biggest exporter Exactly! Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County. San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible &amp; reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational &amp; detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada. Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA. Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected &amp; ignorant “Interim Health Officer” of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!"
2020-05-11,"Don’t mislead the public. State said YES, an unelected county official is the problem. Tesla factory in adjacent San Joaquin county is fully operational. Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me. Yes, California approved, but an unelected county official illegally overrode. Also, all other auto companies in US are approved to resume. Only Tesla has been singled out. This is super messed up! Thanks for the cool suggestions ❤️ More fun coming to your Tesla soon!"
2020-05-12,"All other car companies are allowed to manufacture *except* Tesla, you knucklehead. No wonder you got crushed by a computer the size of a pizza box. Haggerty actually admitted to NYT that he told his staff to “slow down” Tesla for reasons that had nothing to do with health. Unreal …"
2020-05-14,Tesla Supercharger usage by region
2020-05-15,Boring Co will also connect Vegas hotels &amp; airport. Autonomous Teslas in tunnels will provide individualized mass transit. Tesla makes the safest cars in the world &amp; our factory injury rate is better than industry avg &amp; tracking to be better than any auto plant in North America. We care deeply about safety at a fundamental level. Absolutely. Tesla already went through this in China with 7000 employees. Zero fatalities or serious illnesses.
2020-05-18,"The FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval. It that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000. Tesla Full Self-Driving option cost rises by ~$1000 worldwide on July 1st. Order a Tesla online in less than 2 minutes at"
2020-05-29,"Worth noting that, as of Jan 1, Tesla buyers no longer received any federal tax credit. Model 3 led despite this disadvantage. We slowed down a bit to allow Supercharger V3 production to get going, but now will speed up! More Superchargers coming soon!"
2020-06-06,"Starship Production Complex Boca Chica, Texas Order a Tesla online in 2 mins at Tesla Model Y review by Dan Neil"
2020-06-07,Creating the production system is &gt;1000% harder than building one rocket. This is the truly hard thing.
2020-06-08,"Autopilot prime directive is: don’t crash. What seems fast to humans is slow to a computer. 360 degree low light vision &amp; sonar, plus forward radar enable to be superhuman. Upcoming software upgrades will increasingly show the potential."
2020-06-10,"Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast Tesla batteries are lasting much longer than 200k miles / 320k km Moreover, energy produced by Tesla solar deployments far exceeds energy used in our factories Electric cars produce *much* less CO2 than fossil fuel cars, taking both electricity emission &amp; vehicle production into acount Posting Tesla Impact Report, this time with summary points &amp; charts in my reply tweets"
2020-06-11,"Battery industry is world champion at bs. “Lithium-ion” doesn’t really mean anything. What matters is cathode &amp; anode material. There are many choices, but nickel cathode with carbon-silicon anode works great."
2020-06-15,Tesla Model S now first ever electric vehicle to receive EPA range rating above 400 miles! China &amp; Asia Pacific Supercharger usage above pre-covid highs. North America catching up fast. Europe slightly behind.
2020-06-16,No larger pack Model 3 is in development All Model S cars made since late Jan have 402 mile range. This is just making it official.
2020-06-18,"Tesla has an option to purchase this land, but has not exercised it Comes standard with Cybertruck"
2020-06-19,Juneteenth is henceforth considered a US holiday at Tesla &amp; SpaceX
2020-06-20,Stop by The Petersen is you’d like to see Cybertruck irl! Lots of awesome cars &amp; bikes there. Definitely worth seeing with or without Cybertruck.
2020-06-21,"There will be a subscription, but it will be economically better to have bought FSD This would be a good time to upgrade to FSD, as it goes up by $1k on July 1. We could make it $7k to upgrade to FSD until July 1 (even if you don’t have basic Autopilot). Does that sound good? Just us being fools, but free Supercharging forever is not coming back to any vehicles. It’s not a good incentive structure. Haha Teslas all the way down We could probably make a fun punch (click) buggy game, with extra points for rare Teslas For example, we created a chip design team from scratch for the Tesla full self-driving computer, which is not something car companies do Tesla should really be thought of as roughly a dozen technology startups, many of which have little to no correlation with traditional automotive companies We are putting a lot of effort into improving the Tesla China experience with local engineering &amp; great feedback from Tesla owners in China! Cool, lmk what we can do to improve the product, especially vehicle software/firmware, app &amp; overall interaction with Tesla, as these changes can immediately improve the entire fleet Tesla Bioweapon Defense Mode"
2020-06-22,Tentative date for Tesla Shareholder Meeting &amp; Battery Day is Sept 15. Will include tour of cell production system. Reminder that Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD) price goes up by $1k on July 1st Enabling basic Tesla Autopilot via Tesla in-app purchase is reduced to $2k until July 1
2020-06-25,Special thanks to Tesla trucking &amp; rail partners for figuratively &amp; literally going the extra mile Apologies to Tesla customers for shifting delivery dates. It’s a crazy world out there!
2020-06-26,Giga Berlin is gonna rock! Only a matter of time before someone steals a Tesla while playing GTA on a Tesla North American Supercharger usage tracking to exceed pre covid highs in 2 to 3 weeks. Lot of noise out there. This is signal.
2020-06-27,"Physics favors electric transport, batteries for stationary storage &amp; solar/wind for energy generation Major Supercharger increases are underway for the greater LA area"
2020-06-28,"Btw, Tesla actually receives *least* subsidies of any automaker in US. Federal tax credit applies to other automaker EVs, but no longer Tesla. Great Model Y review by"
2020-06-29,Cybertruck does feel like cgi irl
2020-07-01,"I love Texas! Starship production complex is in Boca Chica &amp; SpaceX engine development has been in McGregor for almost 18 years. All questions will be answered on Battery Day, Sept 15th. Will be webcast, although there is much to see in person. Tesla Impact Report (repost). We do everything humanly possible to source materials &amp; produce sustainable energy cars, batteries &amp; solar ethically. Suggestions for improvement are always appreciated."
2020-07-02,"Thanks Tesla owners &amp; investors! Love you!! We will work super hard to earn your trust &amp; support. Tesla will make fabulous short shorts in radiant red satin with gold trim Yes, at Tesla Grohmann Tesla, as a side project, is building RNA microfactories for CureVac &amp; possibly others"
2020-07-03,"Sure, we will aim to do a cross-country drive with Cybertruck later this year"
2020-07-04,"Yeah, Tesla app would enable you to release your car into the fleet &amp; summon it back at will Others will probably pass human trials first, but this machine is pretty special for generalized vaccine production. Was originally intended for rabies, which is a very tricky virus. Congrats Tesla Team — U ROK!!"
2020-07-05,"Yeah, but first we need to finish Giga Berlin and a second US Giga to serve eastern half of North America North American Supercharger usage is now at pre-covid high, Europe about a week behind, China &amp; Asia-Pacific in general doing great"
2020-07-07,"Essentially. Long-term purpose of my Tesla stock is to help make life multiplanetary to ensure it’s continuance. The massive capital needs are in 10 to 20 years. By then, if we’re fortunate, Tesla’s goal of accelerating sustainable energy &amp; autonomy will be mostly accomplished."
2020-07-08,Tesla China team is awesome!
2020-07-10,Berlin Model Y is the one to watch. That is a revolution in automotive body engineering (finally). I spoke with Korolev’s family today. He was one of the very best. Корольов / Королёв.
2020-07-13,"Yes, in plan. Superchargers and public high power wall connectors will keep growing exponentially every year. Doing range testing now. Number will be significantly higher than 300. Extremely good for any EV, especially an SUV. We have reduced pricing on Model Y LR dual motor &amp; will offer a LR single motor Y in a few months, which improves affordability, while still keeping the product excellent We had to increase some wire thicknesses in S/X to reduce resistive heating. Technically, won’t be quite 1000 mph charging, as X especially is much bigger than 3."
2020-07-14,"Tesla Autopilot was literally named after the term used in aviation. Also, what about Autobahn!? The strength &amp; perseverance of the people of Tesla, despite facing extreme difficulties Playable on any Tesla!"
2020-07-15,Gigafactory is the product even more than the car Small note: latch on post near base is gone &amp; powered Ethernet wire is less obtrusive in production version Great work by Tesla software engineering Giga Berlin
2020-07-18,"Solving high-volume, high-reliability, low-cost production problems is especially valued If you’ve solved hard problems with phones / wearables (sealing, signal processing, inductive charging, power mgmt, etc), please consider working at engineering.com"
2020-07-19,"New deep crimson from Giga Berlin is my favorite True, the 2012 Model S is still a great car. Was driving SN28 a few months ago and driving feel was excellent. Model S remains my fav car to drive. Will discuss on Wed earnings call. Lots to talk about!"
2020-07-20,In a few months in production release. Already does that in alpha build.
2020-07-22,"No, best to have people seated for safety &amp; speed of travel Human overseen at first, then fully self-driving We need to finish upgrading Autopilot to 4D vs ~2.5D, then it will go up very steep slopes"
2020-07-23,"We are actually looking for revolutionary actuaries for Tesla Insurance! Please inquire, if interested."
2020-07-24,Thank you on behalf of the Tesla team. We look forward to building Giga Texas! Tesla solar panels are $1.49/Watt
2020-07-25,Cool Model 3 review by Tesla will add a power lift gate at no cost
2020-07-26,"We need high Brinell hardness &amp; high corrosion resistance. Because of Cybertruck’s faceted nature, formability is not important. Some of whom seriously think Tesla toppled the Bolivian govt (sigh)"
2020-07-27,"Giga Berlin will come together at an impossible-seeming speed. The prefabricated construction method in Germany is extremely impressive. Nickel is the biggest challenge for high-volume, long-range batteries! Australia &amp; Canada are doing pretty well. US nickel production is objectively very lame. Indonesia is great!"
2020-07-29,"Tesla is open to licensing software and supplying powertrains &amp; batteries. We’re just trying to accelerate sustainable energy, not crush competitors!"
2020-07-30,Yeah. Display will also soon render Teslas specifically as their model &amp; color instead of as a generic sedan/SUV. Has potential for a fun punch buggy sort of game. Sounds like he doesn’t realize Tesla makes the vaccine machine for CureVac
2020-08-02,"All correct. Parachutes were originally the backup landing system, with SuperDraco thrusters as primary. Difficulty of proving thruster landing safety *and* architecture being suboptimal for moon/Mars caused us to change focus to parachutes."
2020-08-07,Good piece on Giga Berlin construction
2020-08-08,"Over time, since we give all employees shares, my ownership is diluted automatically. From the first financing round, where I owned ~60% of Tesla to today at ~20%, it has declined by a factor of 3. And why aim your attacks at Tesla, when we’re doing more than any other company on Earth to advance green/sustainable energy? Have you read the news? Good analysis. He also includes a govt loan for high efficiency vehicles that Tesla paid back with interest several years, unlike other auto companies."
2020-08-11,SN 5 &amp; 6 at Starship Production Complex in Texas
2020-08-14,"The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap, because it’s a fundamental architectural rewrite, not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home &amp; work. Limited public release in 6 to 10 weeks. Tesla is developing a NN training computer called Dojo to process truly vast amounts of video data. It’s a beast! Please consider joining our AI or computer/chip teams if this sounds interesting. Tesla team is working hard on increasing Powerwall production Probably not faster than utility power can be restored. Powerwall/Powerpack/Megapack can certainly be helpful long-term."
2020-08-15,"Autopilot was trapped in a local maximum, labeling single camera images uncorrelated in time. Now, it is not."
2020-08-16,"Thank you, Tesla is most honored!"
2020-08-17,The “early investor” part of Tesla is wrong. That bs has been pushed by Eberhard (worst person I’ve ever worked with and that’s saying something!) for years. Cybertruck option package
2020-08-18,"My favorite is one in tension, other DoF in compression. New Roadster wheels will only have one nut. Fairing chute control &amp; ship control are closing the loop locally. Both operating on (SpaceX) autopilot."
2020-08-19,"That’s an error in Canada. The lease payment is specifically lower than loan financing, as Tesla expects to repossess the car. This is essentially a bet on residual value. If you believe residual value will rise, buy on loan, if you think it will drop, then lease."
2020-08-20,More fun games coming soon to ur Tesla New Tesla feature coming that enables your car to play snake jazz or Polynesian elevator music through its outside speakers wherever you go
2020-08-25,"Very different computers are needed for training vs inference. FSD is mostly Int8, but Dojo is de facto FP32 (feels like FP32, but actually FP16 with boring bits truncated) so we don’t need to rewrite all the training software. It should work almost immediately."
2020-08-26,"Tesla brake lights are powered by a miniverse inside a microverse No, we’re focused on developing new products &amp; scaling production Mars is easier than the moon for propellant production. Could get going with only one ship, where the ship itself is the propellant plant. Needs to make ~2 tons/day."
2020-08-28,"Neuralink this month &amp; Tesla next month, SpaceX probably October. We will have made a lot of progress by then. Might have a prototype booster hop done by then. Thanks to a smart and hardworking team at Tesla. These sure are wild times …"
2020-08-30,"Tesla Germany designed &amp; built the vaccine RNA printers for CureVac, but, subject to some CureVac IP, they could be made for other companies too That &amp; Giga Berlin are why I’m headed to Germany this week. Conversations with Harvard epidemiology confirmed that a high-speed RNA printer has potential be helpful for vaccines &amp; cures in many areas. One person at Tesla (out of 60,000) was hospitalized in serious condition (he caught cov2 at home, not work), no deaths. I called his wife &amp; Hayward hospital to make sure he was getting the right treatment, but which he was. Some of the tests we initially tried at Tesla were ~50% false positive, including some from major medical device companies. Too many testing methods were approved too quickly. Wouldn’t blame the FDA, though. Public was demanding fast test approval."
2020-09-03,Giga Berlin Mannschaft Vielen Dank für Ihre hervorragende Arbeit an Giga Berlin!!
2020-09-04,Model 3 rated as most reliable car
2020-09-07,"If you bombard Earth with enough photons, eventually it emits a Tesla (AK)"
2020-09-09,"Tesla Model S &amp; X have hospital-grade (HEPA) air filters. 3 &amp; Y are really good too. This has a big effect on health. All Tesla workers also get stock, so their compensation increased proportionately. You are a modern day moron. Rawlinson didn’t design Model S. Prototype was done before he joined &amp; he left us in the lurch just as things got tough, which was not cool. He did make some contributions to body/chassis engineering, but not to powertrain, battery, electronics or software."
2020-09-10,"Try a Tesla &amp; you’re welcome to give it back if you decide you prefer a Subaru Tesla is best understood as a collection of about a dozen startups, mostly in series, increasingly in parallel. Every product line &amp; new production system was invented. Instead of playing chess with the same pieces as everyone else, create new pieces. Tesla R&amp;D productivity is exceptionally good due to the caliber of engineering talent Bitte arbeiten Sie bei Tesla Giga Berlin! Es wird super Spaß machen!!"
2020-09-11,Many exciting things will be unveiled on Battery Day 9/22 ⚡️
2020-09-12,"Releasing private beta in 2 to 4 weeks, public beta (early access owners who opt in) 4 to 6 weeks after that, then all US Tesla owners mid December. Above schedule is contingent upon not encountering major unexpected setbacks."
2020-09-15,"Tunnels under cities with self-driving electric cars will feel like warp drive First operational tunnel under Vegas almost done The Just a guess, but probably mid teens. Booster &amp; stacking on orbital pad are likely limiting factors. We’ll build several ships just to improve the production system. Pretty accurate simulation, although SN8 will use 3 Raptors. If SN8 craters, SN9 &amp; SN10 are close behind. High production rate allows for fast iteration."
2020-09-16,Fallout Shelter is on your Tesla. Tap the Entertainment button.
2020-09-19,"It took an utterly insane amount of work to move the SpaceX &amp; Tesla success probabilities above ~zero To be frank, in the early days, I thought there was &gt;90% chance that both SpaceX &amp; Tesla would be worth $0. The press &amp; aerospace / automotive industry at the time (correctly) agreed with me."
2020-09-20,"There’ll be lots of green space around factory, but building itself is continuous. The “open” areas inside are covered. They’re internal semi truck roads inside a giant monolithic building."
2020-09-21,"We intend to increase, not reduce battery cell purchases from Panasonic, LG &amp; CATL (possibly other partners too). However, even with our cell suppliers going at maximum speed, we still foresee significant shortages in 2022 &amp; beyond unless we also take action ourselves. Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow. This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck &amp; Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022. Good analysis, although I think we should wait until FSD is a bit more mature I’m pretty sure Tesla could do a much better autocorrect. The bar is so low haha."
2020-09-22,"The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It’s 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself."
2020-09-23,"Roadster will be better Cybertruck, ATV, Roadster &amp; Semi C A R S"
2020-09-26,"Suppliers. We’re only doing high energy nickel ourselves, at least for now. Also, maybe the presentation wasn’t clear that we’ve actually had our cells in packs driving cars for several months. Prototypes are trivial, volume production is hard. Totally up to you, but if you head to a Tesla delivery center near you &amp; maybe help out new owners, that would be cool Thanks Tesla Team for great work on deliveries! For new owners, we super appreciate accommodating us on delivery timing! Definitely one of our toughest quarters in global logistics."
2020-09-28,"That’s total market, not all Tesla. We do see Tesla reaching 20M vehicles/year probably before 2030, but that requires consistently excellent execution. We aren’t cutting the price of Model 3 to $25k. I was referring to a future car that will be smaller than Model 3."
2020-09-29,Having a low center of gravity makes a world of difference to safety
2020-10-01,The new heat pump in Model Y is what really makes the difference in cold weather
2020-10-03,Vector-space bird’s eye view coming with FSD
2020-10-05,"Turn volume to 11 &amp; play Powerglide in your Tesla FSD will solve these issues Music volume on a Tesla goes to 11, because it’s louder than 10 This article is wildly incorrect about lithium battery costs by a factor of 5 or more presently &amp; 10X long-term"
2020-10-07,"Autopilot team is making great progress. Reality sure is complicated! That would be like licensing Battlestar Galactica. Actually building continuously evolving gargantuan factories is the hard part. Lots of people who worked at Tesla Gigafactories now work at competitors, but none of those companies have made one. Yes, the Gigafactory is the hardest &amp; most critical product Battery pack will be a bonded structure with cells providing shear transfer between steel upper &amp; lower face sheets, eliminating most of the center body parts while providing better torsional rigidity &amp; improved polar moment or inertia. This is a *major* breakthrough. But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term. Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy. The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three. Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it’s fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly. Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can’t emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part. Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings. Also, a new paint system. Lot of new technology will happen in Berlin, which means significant production risk. Fremont &amp; Shanghai will transition in ~2 years when new tech is proven."
2020-10-08,"Meant to say that it should be fixed in the latest wide release. Won’t need to wait for FSD. Waymo is impressive, but a highly specialized solution. The Tesla approach is a general solution. The latest build is capable of zero intervention drives. Will release limited beta in a few weeks."
2020-10-10,Great work by SpaceX valve engineering &amp; production!
2020-10-11,"There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard’s problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze’ev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO. When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me &amp; the board, no one left with him. That says it all. SpaceX/Tesla metallurgy &amp; new materials team is next-level"
2020-10-12,"With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn’t clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, it’s right. Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual. Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers. Tesla FSD computer’s dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes — they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails. We face a tough dichotomy of applying resources to the old architecture or applying them to the new. It’s not a question of money. If there was a “great engineer” factory, we would place a large order! Unfortunately, great engineers are very rare. This is solved in the FSD build."
2020-10-14,"Starting production on 7 seater next month, initial deliveries early December The gauntlet has been thrown down! The prophecy will be fulfilled. Model S price changes to $69,420 tonight! We simplified this a lot. It’s basically just Teslas in tunnels at this point, which is way more profound than it sounds."
2020-10-16,Current production is slightly better
2020-10-20,"FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should."
2020-10-21,"Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt)."
2020-10-22,"Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year. Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday Dependent on proving high safety"
2020-10-23,Great pics! That we now have the beginnings of a Starship production system is most meaningful.
2020-10-24,Visualization will tone down significantly for production. These are intentionally strident colors.
2020-10-27,Tesla team has done great work!
2020-10-29,Tesla should make catgirl robots?
2020-10-31,Thanks to a great Autopilot/AI team working super hard! Doing “neural nets” without testing them against reality has led some groups to overestimate what they’re doing. Reality is the hardest sim.
2020-11-01,Tesla Texas team is making great progress! Giga Texas factory will be an asskicker.
2020-11-02,Didn’t realize that was possible. No problem if there’s a way get current design Cybertruck approved in Europe!
2020-11-03,"Closest we got was about a month. The Model 3 ramp was extreme stress &amp; pain for a long time — from mid 2017 to mid 2019. Production &amp; logistics hell. I put in my last money, even though I thought we would still fail. But, it was either that or certain death for Tesla. Extremely difficult to raise money for an electric car startup (considered super quirky back then), while stalwarts like GM &amp; Chrysler were going bankrupt."
2020-11-05,Recruiting ace engineers for Giga Berlin! Will interview in person tomorrow on site. Send resume to 25Guns.com.
2020-11-06,"Faraday invented the electric motor, Tesla the (commutator-free, three-phase) AC induction motor, in other words, a useful electric motor Maxwell was amazing. Should have more recognition. Tesla Motors, Inc., was almost called Faraday, as it took until late 2004/2005 to buy the trademark from a guy who had had it since 1995."
2020-11-08,Enough already on my plate &amp; Tesla’s. Maybe one day will do a prototype. Those are relatively easy. Volume production with high reliability &amp; low cost &amp; passing all regulations is 100X harder. ♠️♠️ Tesla Autopilot/AI team ♠️♠️
2020-11-09,"I do expect this to become an important product for the world, but probably not financially material for Tesla Tesla makes the RNA Bioreactor that can make vaccines / cures. CureVac has version 2 in use. Version 3 is under development. Thanks to a lot of great Autopilot/AI hardware &amp; software engineers at Tesla! Wait until you see what Cybertruck will do"
2020-11-13,"Technically, I tested positive, then negative twice, then positive again, so “Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid” is an equally correct title. The “rapid antigen test” from BD seems to be about as useful as a flipping a coin."
2020-11-15,"Dragon can also hover &amp; land propulsively, but we use the parachutes for maximum safety Thrusters are integrated with spacecraft, enabling abort capability all the way to abort for increased safety"
2020-11-16,"CureVac, Moderna &amp; a few others. Tesla makes the machine CureVac uses to go from known gene sequence to trillions of lipid-coated mRNA strands."
2020-11-17,"Absolutely. Production/testing of rocket engines is over 90% of the problem. This is true in general. For cars, production is over 99% of the problem. That 1% inspiration is very important, but it’s less than 1% of the pain. They’re on their way! Hopefully, more Teslaquila next month."
2020-11-18,The only publicly traded stock I own is Tesla Tesla holiday software release is
2020-11-19,Safety is our primary design goal
2020-11-20,"This is a misperception. SpaceX developed &amp; continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with . Just pointless imo for self-driving. If you’re going to do active photon generation, use an occlusion penetrating wavelength, like precision radar at ~4mm. Andrej is awesome, but it should be said that we have a very talented Autopilot/AI team at Tesla. Too much credit comes to me &amp; Andrej."
2020-11-21,"We have quiet a queue of products to build! Better do new Roadster at some point. Tesla is a vehicle for creating &amp; producing many useful products Because I am not an investor. Tesla is definitely not the only good company, but investing is not what I do. But I always put my own money into companies I help create, otherwise it’d be wrong to ask others to do so."
2020-11-24,"Rapid &amp; complete rocket reuse, low cost propellant, orbital refilling &amp; propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary We’re still far from simply video in, control out. The biggest game-changer, currently underway at Tesla, is 360 degree, high fps video for labeling, training &amp; inference. FSD Beta 5 coming out in a few days. Improvement should be significant."
2020-11-25,"We will have special colors for new Roadster, as we did for the original"
2020-11-26,"Ok. Overall air suspension height &amp; damping algorithm is getting a lot of attention. Will be linked to FSD, so acts automatically."
2020-12-02,"Award accepted on behalf of the great people at Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink &amp; Boring Co"
2020-12-15,"Giga Berlin-Brandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture, 4680 (world’s most advanced cells, made on-site), both front &amp; rear body castings &amp; advanced paint shop. Warning: with so much new technology, production timing is naturally harder to predict."
2020-12-17,"It will get absurdly good. Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! There’s some great AI out there, but can it self-drive while playing Cyberpunk … ?"
2020-12-20,Absolutely. We will release FSD subscription early next year.
2020-12-21,"Thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make Tesla successful. My heart goes out to you. They are, although it’s kind low-key. Tesla Superchargers are being made accessible to other electric cars."
2020-12-22,"During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting. Strange, if true. - Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory. - A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?"
2020-12-24,"To Tesla owners taking delivery in the final days of year, your support is super appreciated!!"
2020-12-25,"Engineering, design &amp; general company operations absorb vast majority of my mind &amp; are the fundamental limitation on doing more. Capital allocation is important, but low CPU load. Tesla public company duties are a much bigger factor, but going private is impossible now (sigh). Change your horn sound to , , or holiday jingles with latest Tesla software update!"
2020-12-26,"There are subtle, important, differences between US &amp; Canada traffic rules, but FSD beta will be extended to Canada very soon"
2020-12-27,"Try playing Polytopia in your Tesla! Great game. Multiplayer online version coming soon. Roughly 95% of parts in Tesla Roadster were unique — not in any other product. Unfortunately, since we started out with the (dumb, in retrospect) goal of simply adapting Lotus Elise to electric, we ended up with a 10% too small sports car that seems kinda like a Lotus."
2020-12-28,Just meeting with Larry Ellison to seek some advice. Back working on Tesla end of quarter tomorrow. What should Tesla do with in-car gaming in an autonomous world?
2020-12-29,"All Tesla cars delivered in the final three days of the year will get three months of the Full Self-Driving option for free. Delivery &amp; docs must be fully complete by midnight Dec 31st. No, these are just incremental improvements to the production codebase. FSD build is a fundamental rewrite, not just in the car, but also our video training/labeling software."
2020-12-30,"Production is hard, prototypes are easy. Building ~1000 Starships to create a self-sustaining city on Mars is our mission. Seems odd that the opposition group is from BMW’s home state of Baveria. That‘s very far from Brandenburg, where Tesla is building the Gigafactory. And why would a group that claims to be pro-environment oppose a sustainable energy factory? Aren’t there more important issues?"
2021-01-01,"Dojo isn’t needed, but will make self-driving better. It isn’t enough to be safer than human drivers, Autopilot ultimately needs to be more than 10 times safer than human drivers."
2021-01-02,"Tesla is responsible for 2/3 of all the personal &amp; professional pain in my life combined. But it was worth it. So proud of the Tesla team for achieving this major milestone! At the start of Tesla, I thought we had (optimistically) a 10% chance of surviving at all. Tesla Full Self-Driving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year, of that I am confident. Can’t speak for regulators though."
2021-01-04,Snow falling on Giga Berlin
2021-01-09,"Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar. One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations"
2021-01-14,"Prototypes are easy, volume production is hard, positive cash flow is excruciating"
2021-01-16,Cybertruck doesn’t need a garage
2021-01-18,The rate-limiting part or process in cell production is constantly changing Battery cell production is the fundamental rate-limiter slowing down a sustainable energy future. Very important problem. Looking into this. No question that FSD should be viewed as reasonably valuable when doing a trade-in.
2021-01-23,We’re switching to a more sensible FSD version numbering to distinguish between major &amp; minor updates. Current build is FSD 8.1. It drove me to an unfamiliar location in LA &amp; back last night with no interventions!
2021-01-25,"Yes, although it will be crazy not to turn on FSD Tesla is steadily moving all NNs to 8 camera surround video. This will enable superhuman self-driving. Sorry for the version confusion. V8.1 is what it should say for FSD. Separate version number for rest of car. To my surprise, Tesla has better AI hardware &amp; software than Waymo (money)"
2021-01-28,"Finishing engineering this year, production starts next year. Aiming to have release candidate design drivable late summer. Tri-motor drive system &amp; advanced battery work were important precursors. New Roadster is part rocket First production car ever to achieve 0 to 60 mph in less than 2 seconds Plaid Model S ships next month"
2021-01-29,I sure hope that’s not true at Tesla or SpaceX!
2021-02-01,"Neuralink is working super hard to ensure implant safety &amp; is in close communication with the FDA. If things go well, we might be able to do initial human trials later this year. Giga Berlin progress"
2021-02-04,No need to be a gigachad to own
2021-02-06,Time to tell the story of Tesla &amp; SpaceX
2021-02-09,"Lowest cost per ton of carbon sequestered, net of value of any product made. Must be scalable to gigaton level. Aiming for maximum usefulness. Everyone at Tesla receives stock. My comp is all stock/options, which I do not take off the table. That’s what you’re missing."
2021-02-11,Congratulations Tesla China for amazing execution last year. Now on to the next for even more!!
2021-02-18,SpaceX in south Texas &amp; Tesla in central have been providing direct assistance where feasible (eg save cold turtles &amp; help power the water treatment plant). Please let us know if we may be helpful in other ways.
2021-02-19,"To be clear, I am *not* an investor, I am an engineer. I don’t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla. However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere. Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is “almost”. Tesla’s action is not directly reflective of my opinion. Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&amp;P500 company."
2021-02-20,"Most people have no idea, even though there are so many FSD progress videos posted. Munro understood right away. There will be a gap before the next release, but then it will be a step change better. Tesla is solving a major real-world AI problem."
2021-02-22,"It is still available off menu, but I don’t think the range, in many drive conditions, yet meets the Tesla standard of excellence The Tesla Solar Roof is slightly hydrophobic, so water, snow or ice slide off easily"
2021-02-25,"Nickel is our biggest concern for scaling lithium-ion cell production. That’s why we are shifting standard range cars to an iron cathode. Plenty of iron (and lithium)! This is not about winning anyone over. We are production-limited. The reason we are making our own cells is to *supplement* max production of suppliers. Even moving at full speed, they cannot build enough cells. Prices in the US (of all goods) don’t include VAT, but it’s usually included in other countries. Then there’s import duty &amp; transport costs. The intent is that revenue to Tesla is roughly similar in all countries, so taxes, tariffs &amp; transport make up the difference."
2021-02-26,Do androids dream of electric cars?
2021-03-01,"Tesla China team rocks! Note, buying FSD will still be a better long-term deal than subscription"
2021-03-02,Horses are even self-driving!
2021-03-03,FSD beta build V8.1 normally drives me around with no interventions. Next version is a big step change beyond that. Tesla is solving a major part of real-world AI. This is not widely known.
2021-03-04,"Tesla &amp; Ford are the only American carmakers not to have gone bankrupt out of 1000’s of car startups. Prototypes are easy, production is hard &amp; being cash flow positive is excruciating."
2021-03-05,"Tesla AI, both hardware &amp; software, is deeply underestimated"
2021-03-06,"Update probably in Q2. Cybertruck will be built at Giga Texas, so focus right now is on getting that beast built. The Tesla FSD computer started shipping in volume in Q2 2019. 2020 cars should all have FSD computers, whether or not ordered as an option. Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development &amp; testing. Note: word “Beta” is used to reduce complacency in usage &amp; set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation &amp; QA drive teams. Due to high levels of demand for FSD Beta, adding “Download Beta” button to Service section of car display in ~10 days If you want the Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta downloaded to your car, let us know. Doubling beta program size now with 8.2 &amp; probably 10X size with 8.3. Still be careful, but it’s getting mature."
2021-03-08,"Not connecting Tesla cars to Starlink, as our terminal is much too big. This is for aircraft, ships, large trucks &amp; RVs."
2021-03-09,"Build 8.3 of FSD should be done QA testing by end of next week, so that’s roughly when download button should show up Assuming user approves warning &amp; agrees to drive carefully, it will download latest QA-tested FSD “Beta” build as soon as car connects to wifi"
2021-03-10,Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous.
2021-03-11,"Like , but *with* self-driving haha"
2021-03-12,FSD Beta has now been expanded to ~2000 owners &amp; we’ve also revoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the road. No accidents to date. Next significant release will be in April. Going with pure vision — not even using radar. This is the way to real-world AI.
2021-03-14,"Play your favorite song in a Tesla &amp; turn the volume to 11 You will see. You will feel. What has become absolutely clear is that the plethora of self-driving corner cases can only be solved with real-world optical intelligence. This is how humans designed the road system to work. Once you have that in silicon form, everything else is just icing on the cake."
2021-03-18,"Yes, Booster 1 is a production pathfinder, figuring out how to build &amp; transport 70 meter tall stage. Booster 2 will fly."
2021-03-23,I once did a road trip across most of US with 2 adults &amp; 5 kids in a Model S! The new Plaid S is our best car ever. Will be first production car to achieve 0-60mph in under 2 secs &amp; it has four doors &amp; seats up to 7 people.
2021-03-24,"Tesla is using only internal &amp; open source software &amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly. Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency. You can now buy a Tesla with Bitcoin"
2021-03-26,I think there is a &gt;0% chance Tesla could be the biggest company Solar has come a long way. Now just needs lots of long-life batteries!
2021-03-27,"This is crazy. Should use Tesla Megapacks for load-leveling the grid. More effective, more reliable and costs less."
2021-03-30,"Agreed! We’re not super far, as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. We’re also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW, paired with Tesla Megapacks, for continuous power. Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high. However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating &amp; land intact. A high production rate solves many ills Demand is no problem, but near-term cell supply makes it hard to scale Semi. This limitation will be less onerous next year."
2021-03-31,"Over 10,000 people are needed for Giga Texas just through 2022! - 5 mins from airport -15 mins from downtown - Right on Colorado river"
2021-04-02,Major new Supercharger station coming to Santa Monica soon! Hoping to have 50’s diner &amp; 100 best movie clips playing too. Thanks Santa Monica city!
2021-04-05,Special mention of Tesla China Great work by Tesla team!
2021-04-08,Thanks Tesla suppliers for providing us with critical parts!
2021-04-09,"Almost ready with FSD Beta V9.0. Step change improvement is massive, especially for weird corner cases &amp; bad weather. Pure vision, no radar. Comes with wireless charging baseball cap"
2021-04-10,"If you don’t say anything &amp; engage Autopilot, it will soon guess based on time of day, taking you home or to work or to what’s on your calendar Good point. Next major software rev will do much better with automating wipers, seat heating &amp; defrost. Probable seat settings just based on occupant mass distribution should be possible."
2021-04-13,"Tesla is building up collision repair capability to help address the grief that you went through, but usually insurance companies make you go their “approved” collision repair partners. Tesla Insurance will make it smooth sailing."
2021-04-14,"Button timing of May is aspirational. Depends on how well limited beta of V9.0 goes, but I would be surprised if wide beta (aka button) is later than June. FSD subscription next month is a sure thing. Major improvements are being made to the vision stack every week. Beta button hopefully next month. This is a “march of 9’s” trying to get probability of no injury above 99.999999% of miles for city driving. Production Autopilot is already above that for highway driving. Tesla AI/Autopilot engineering is awesome! Making excellent progress solving real-world AI."
2021-04-15,"While perhaps obvious in hindsight, it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world AI. That is what Tesla is doing, both in hardware &amp; software. Unless a company is good at AI with tight compute, it’s hopeless. This is insanely hard."
2021-04-16,"Limited production of Model Y this year, high volume next year I was just there, driving Cybertruck around the site where it will be built!"
2021-04-17,"Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. Doesn’t mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer. Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle Great progress by Tesla team"
2021-04-19,"Your research as a private individual is better than professionals ! Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD. Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have."
2021-04-20,New FSD rendering approach coming that better represents NN probability vector space
2021-04-21,"Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home. Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid."
2021-04-22,"I’m staying at a friend’s place in Florida that is 85% powered by Tesla Solar Roof + Powerwall. When grid power goes down, air-conditioning automatically turns off in some of the house. Computers &amp; lights don’t even flicker. Owner says he doesn’t notice. If Tesla owners are “conspiracy theorists”, then it would be fair to call them “advertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers”. If that’s an unfair criticism, a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is ~0.02% of deaths … Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility Very important. Most people don’t know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries. Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp. In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc. Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised. Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month. Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp. Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts. Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery"
2021-04-26,"No, you do not. I have not sold any of my Bitcoin. Tesla sold 10% of its holdings essentially to prove liquidity of Bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet. Yeah, roughly 200MW/km^2 using currently available solar panels. What’s really amazing is that you can store all energy needed to power a continent overnight with 1 square kilometer of stacked Tesla Megapacks! We just got approval to open a new Supercharger station in Malibu!"
2021-04-27,"Other companies spend money on advertising &amp; manipulating public opinion, Tesla focuses on the product. I trust the people."
2021-04-29,"A major part of real-world AI has to be solved to make unsupervised, generalized full self-driving work, as the entire road system is designed for biological neural nets with optical imagers FSD display V9.0 will show actual probability distribution of objects – true mind’s eye of the neural net. This is so cool! I swear Canada FSD beta will be as soon as humanly possible! True. Anyone paying attention to the rate of improvement will realize that Tesla Autopilot/FSD is already superhuman for highway driving &amp; swiftly getting there for city streets. Gating factor is achieving &amp; proving higher safety with pure vision than with vision+radar. We are almost there. FSD Beta V9.0 will blow your mind."
2021-05-03,"Prototypes are easy, production is hard Rawlinson was never chief engineer. He arrived after Model S prototype was made, left before things got tough &amp; was only ever responsible for body engineering, not powertrain, battery, software, production or design."
2021-05-08,Cybertruck prototype in New York this weekend
2021-05-11,Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?
2021-05-12,"I think we’re maybe a month or two away from wide beta. But these things are hard to predict accurately. The work we had to do for pure vision driving was needed for FSD, so much more progress has been made than it would seem. End of year, along with FSD, provided we get regulatory approval. Smart Summon is just a subset of FSD. We had to focus on removing radar &amp; confirming safety. That release goes out next week to US production. Then a week or two to polish pure vision FSD &amp; v9 beta will release. Difference between v8 &amp; v9 is gigantic."
2021-05-17,"To clarify speculation, Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin"
2021-05-18,"Aiming for extreme precision with next gen Model Y – microns, not millimeters Giga Berlin suppliers please accelerate! Going through all aspects of next gen Model Y production system with team. Lot of talented people at Giga Berlin. This place will rock!"
2021-05-19,Tesla has
2021-05-20,"A longtime Tesla supporter gave me the Doge dollar sticker at Giga Berlin Oh sorry, yes, Roadster will have thrusters, not Plaid. Plaid is indeed close to the theoretical maximum of a roadworthy car without special devices. Diess is right. Hydrogen is a staggeringly dumb form of energy storage for cars. Barely worth considering it for a rocket upper stage, which is its most compelling use. Tesla Model S Plaid delivery event June 3 at our California factory Fastest production car ever 0 to 60mph in under 2 secs Production article will look different (better)"
2021-05-21,"We can’t wait to build this crazy truck! It’s a total rethink of vehicle mechanical architecture &amp; production methods, so super hard project, but worthwhile in the end."
2021-05-26,"Pure vision Autopilot is now rolling out in North America. There will be an update of this production release in 2 weeks, then FSD beta V9.0 (also pure vision) a week later. FSD subscription will be enabled around the same time."
2021-05-27,"Tesla sure would appreciate changing the law, so that this is not required!"
2021-05-29,Model S Plaid delivery pushed to June 10. Needs one more week of tweak. This car feels like a spaceship. Words cannot describe the limbic resonance.
2021-05-30,Raptor production is approaching one every 48 hours
2021-05-31,"Making this work has been / still is super difficult, but it’s a revolution in car body design &amp; production – lighter, tighter, better NVH, higher precision, lower capex, lower unit cost Moving lumbar was removed only in front passenger seat of 3/Y (obv not there in rear seats). Logs showed almost no usage. Not worth cost/mass for everyone when almost never used. Prices increasing due to major supply chain price pressure industry-wide. Raw materials especially."
2021-06-01,"Yeah, new Model S &amp; X have PS5 level entertainment computing power"
2021-06-02,"That’s where we get most of our lithium. Also, whereas phone batteries make heavy use of cobalt in cathode, Tesla uses primarily nickel, which is trickier, but has better energy density (range). Iron cathode cells are now competitive for stationary packs &amp; mid range cars. Our biggest challenge is supply chain, especially microcontroller chips. Never seen anything like it. Fear of running out is causing every company to overorder – like the toilet paper shortage, but at epic scale. That said, it’s obv not a long-term issue."
2021-06-06,"0 to 60mph in under 2 secs. Quickest production car ever made of any kind. Has to be felt to be believed. Model S goes to Plaid speed this week One more production release of pure vision this week, then FSD beta 9 a week or two later. V9.0 FSD is also pure vision. Foundational improvements are immense. The operating costs of a Tesla are also much lower than a gasoline cruiser!"
2021-06-07,The long-term strength of Tesla will be manufacturing technology
2021-06-09,"Yeah, sold my houses, except for 1 in Bay Area that’s rented out for events. Working on sustainable energy for Earth with Tesla &amp; protecting future of consciousness by making life multiplanetary with SpaceX. Also, AI risk mitigation with Neuralink &amp; fixing traffic with Boring. Exactly. Only time I sell Tesla stock is when my stock options are expiring &amp; I have no choice. Btw, I will continue to pay income taxes in California proportionate to my time in state, which is &amp; will be significant. Tesla Europe team is doing great!"
2021-06-11,Order Tesla Model S Plaid at Tesla engineering is awesome!
2021-06-13,"This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market. When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions. The Plaid carbon-wrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere. We have to keep some secrets! We have a few ideas for increasing torque &amp; max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun &amp; exciting engineering ahead! Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation. Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion. Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator."
2021-06-14,"After several successful launches, land overflight earlier in trajectory passes E-sub-c safety threshold. That said, Starship will also launch from Cape long-term."
2021-06-16,Massive increase in Supercharger network is underway Most people have no idea just how good the Tesla air purification system is. Literally 10X better than any other car.
2021-06-21,"Tesla financing round closed at 6pm Dec 24th 2008 – last hour of last day possible or payroll would’ve bounced 2 days later. I gave Tesla last of my remaining cash from PayPal. Didn’t even own a house or anything sellable. Looking at holding Tesla AI Day in about a month or so. Will go over progress with Tesla AI software &amp; hardware, both training &amp; inference. Purpose is recruiting."
2021-06-24,At least a few years before Starlink revenue is reasonably predictable. Going public sooner than that would be very painful. Will do my best to give long-term Tesla shareholders preference. Shout out to the awesome Tesla global team. Thanks for working so hard to make Tesla successful!
2021-06-25,"Sometimes people think it is performance, but safety is always the primary design requirement for a Tesla Actually, a great many parts are produced by our suppliers, but Tesla is more vertically integrated than other carmakers I’m driving “alpha” 9, but we need to fix some obvious issues before releasing beta 9, hopefully next week. FSD subscription capability should be turning on via the Tesla app."
2021-06-29,"Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the “keep out zone”, which is unreasonably gigantic. There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken. Top Safety Pick+ from IIHS! That’s the highest overall rating, but we think we can get max score for all subcategories/individual tests too. Retesting in a month or so with improved software. The improved software will then be uploaded to all cars with FSD computers. Production release update coming this week, which includes raising max speed to 80 mph. Sorry, 75 mph limit was done as precautionary measure. Turned out to be unnecessary."
2021-07-01,"Sorry for any confusion. Dojo is a neural network training computer optimized for video (for self-driving). Unless there is a predictable pattern to hashing Scrypt (which we will not attempt to find), it will not be competitive with ASIC-based hashing. Potatoes are delicious!"
2021-07-02,"Yes. Long-term, all settings will be in your Tesla app and car will auto adjust. Congrats Tesla Team on over 200,000 car built &amp; delivered in Q2, despite many challenges!! These days, I mostly just play Polytopia, which comes free with every Tesla! When we need strange training examples, eg half a car on highway, Tesla sim delivers. Also, accidents on Autopilot are becoming rarer, so we need more close call examples. For safety tests, Autopilot sees dummy far away. Emergency braking only needed for distracted drivers."
2021-07-03,"Haha, FSD 9 beta is shipping soon, I swear! Generalized self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI. Didn’t expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect. Nothing has more degrees of freedom than reality. Friday afternoons are usually Tesla design studio time. Cybertruck will be almost exactly what was shown. We’re adding rear wheel steering, so it can do tight turns &amp; maneuver with high agility. Lot of other great things coming."
2021-07-05,"Design is easy, production is hard"
2021-07-06,"Soft spot for olde Roadster Caused by switching frequency of light source. Surround video (multiple cameras, across several frames), improving fps &amp; exposure setting tweaks solves this. All in FSD build. Yes, updated UI coming with FSD wide release. All cars with FSD computer will have new “mind of car” view. All 3/Y can be upgraded to have FSD computer."
2021-07-07,"Nikola Tesla was born in Croatia (to Serbian parents)! And by 2060, Tesla production will exceed the mass of the Universe! Working with Weddle and Sons Roofing has been a great collaboration for accelerating Tesla Solar Roof installation! This is a lot of work, as tens of millions of homes need solar roofs! If you are a roofing company, please consider adding Solar Roof to your offerings."

2021-07-10,"The challenges of operating at Starbase left us with no choice but to put engine production in McGregor By “volume production”, I mean 2 to 4 engines per day. That’s super high volume for big rocket engines, but low volume by automotive standards. We are breaking ground soon on a second Raptor factory at SpaceX Texas test site. This will focus on volume production of Raptor 2, while California factory will make Raptor Vacuum &amp; new, experimental designs. Accurate assessment. Btw, Autopilot software is technically led by Ashok, Andrej &amp; Milan, but it’s very much a “knights of the round table” structure. There are so many talented engineers on Autopilot/AI team &amp; they decide for themselves what to work on. Kinda like Valve."
2021-07-12,"Not yet, but they will. It’s needed for full self-driving."
2021-07-14,Review of Model S Plaid by Dan Neil
2021-07-15,"FSD beta 9 is using the pure vision production code for highway driving. Beta 10 hopefully (Beta 11 definitely) will use one stack to rule them all – city streets, highway &amp; complex parking lots. In end, we kept production design almost exactly same as show car. Just some small tweaks here &amp; there to make it slightly better. No door handles. Car recognizes you &amp; opens door. Having all four wheels steer is amazing for nimble handling &amp; tight turns! To be frank, there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop, because it is so unlike anything else. I don’t care. I love it so much even if others don’t. Other trucks look like copies of the same thing, but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future. Not bad, although new Model S has more range &amp; faster charging. 3 &amp; Y should use long range version, as Performance version is meant for max speed &amp; handling, not max range. Supercharger network is being upgraded to 250kW to 300kW, so that will help too. Glad it’s working! The sheer amount of work done by SpaceX engineering, production &amp; launch teams is amazing. Ping should improve dramatically in coming months. We’re aiming for &lt;20ms. Basically, you should be able to play competitive FPS games through Starlink."
2021-07-16,"Indeed, but again like a parking lot, a battery having big “roads” tends to decrease number of “parking spaces” (ie stores less energy)"
2021-07-17,"Current Summon is sometimes useful, but mostly just a fun trick. Once we move summon (plus highway driving) to a single FSD stack, it will be sublime. Wide beta maybe with FSD rev 10, definitely with rev 11"
2021-07-19,You don’t even need to touch the shifter in new S. Auto detect direction will come as an optional setting to all cars with FSD.
2021-07-20,"We created our own connector, as there was no standard back then &amp; Tesla was only maker of long range electric cars. It’s one fairly slim connector for both low &amp; high power charging. That said, we’re making our Supercharger network open to other EVs later this year."
2021-07-21,"Dry electrode is a key piece (one of many pieces) of the puzzle for lowering cost of lithium batteries. That said, it has required an *immense* amount of engineering to take Maxwell’s proof-of-concept to high-quality, volume production &amp; we’re still not quite done."
2021-07-23,"If Tesla is able to succeed with imported vehicles, then a factory in India is quite likely. Tesla Model S Plaid is alien technology Also, the full self-driving interface renders across the whole display &amp; it is incredible. The yoke enables an unobstructed view of the screen."
2021-07-25,I was at Giga Texas yesterday. Team is making excellent progress. Building will be almost a mile long when complete. Tesla Giga Shanghai team has done amazing work!
2021-07-26,"Ships are probably fine with iron cells, but aircraft need very high energy density for good range. I’m not saying Tesla will do aircraft – we have our hands full with cars &amp; solar/battery power generation – just that max energy density is needed for aircraft. We will try. Preferable for Tesla too, as they last so long. Unlike other makers of cars, our goal is *not* to profit from service. Best service is not needing service in the first place."
2021-07-27,"That’s a low bar. Carmakers have never valued software engineering highly, although VW is trying to change that. I personally wrote software for 20 years &amp; have huge respect for software engineers. Tesla is on par with best software companies &amp; is leader in real world AI. Tesla software team is excellent even when compared to the best software companies. This is a big deal, as cars are very much computers on wheels. Great work by Tesla Giga Berlin team &amp; supporting contractors! Cars today are far more complex than Model T, with a global supply chain that is vulnerable to force majeure risk. Like Model T, supply chain for battery EVs simply doesn’t exist at massive scale, so must be built in parallel. Ideas are easy, production is hard."
2021-07-29,"Haha true. I talked to my friends about electric cars constantly in college. Convincing the best AI talent to join Tesla is the sole goal Tesla AI Day August 19th Haha ok, I will do the Tesla shareholder meeting in a posh British accent These guys are either shady, 🥜 or both. I mean seriously there’s a long list of companies to pick on before Tesla …"
2021-07-30,"Actually, I like &amp; use Apple products. They are just obviously overcharging with App Store. I mean 30% fees for doing almost zero incremental work is completely unreasonable. Epic wouldn’t bother processing their own payments if App Store fees were fair. Cook &amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever. There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla. There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever. He refused to meet. Tesla was worth about 6% of today’s value. This should be clear to anyone who has experienced the FSD beta evolution. Self-driving requires solving a major part of real-world AI, so it’s an insanely hard problem, but Tesla is getting it done. AI Day will be great."
2021-07-31,"Reason we hustled so much to get Autopilot V1 out was that someone driving non-Autopilot Tesla fell asleep, crashed &amp; killed cyclist (Tesla driver was uninjured). Driver nonetheless sued us saying new car smell made him fall asleep (sigh). Judge didn’t agree. The Tesla AI predictions are swiftly becoming superhuman – its guesses for what it can’t see well feel like ESP. It has a vastly larger training set than any human &amp; thinks only about driving. PC desktop with latest graphics card, although I have a Mac too. Gigabyte laptop. Tesla policy is never to give in to false claims, even if we would lose, and never to fight true claims, even if we would win."
2021-08-02,That’s about right. Civilization can be powered with a very small % of Earth having solar panels.
2021-08-04,"I do think that great design &amp; engineering of products are critical, but manufacturing &amp; supply chain require orders of magnitude more work"
2021-08-05,"Yeah, seems odd that Tesla wasn’t invited If you’re curious about Tesla, SpaceX &amp; my general goings on, is writing a biography"
2021-08-06,"Tesla Automation (Deutschland) built a specialized machine to wrap the rotor with carbon fiber at precise tension. If too low, it would come loose at low temp, due to CTE differences. If too high, it would snap at high temp &amp; rpm."
2021-08-10,"Important to bear in mind that production is as fast as the slowest part out of ~10,000 unique parts in a car"
2021-08-11,I’d recommend they get their first plant working. It’s insanely difficult to reach volume production at affordable unit cost.
2021-08-12,"Tesla makes cars for export in first half of quarter &amp; for local market in second half. As publicly disclosed, we are operating under extreme supply chain limitations regarding certain “standard” automotive chips. Most problematic by far are Renesas &amp; Bosch."

2021-08-20,"We have almost all the pieces needed for humanoid robots, since we already make robots with wheels"
2021-08-23,"FSD Beta 9.2 is actually not great imo, but Autopilot/AI team is rallying to improve as fast as possible. We’re trying to have a single stack for both highway &amp; city streets, but it requires massive NN retraining."
2021-08-24,Just drove FSD Beta 9.3 from Pasadena to LAX. Much improved!
2021-08-26,Tesla China rocks!
2021-08-28,"Yeah, we should tie Autopilot driving style preference &amp; various warning settings together in general"
2021-08-30,Thank for bringing this up. Tesla will expedite service center openings. Have you tried our mobile service that comes to you?
2021-09-01,"I was in the Berlin paint shop talking to the team on my last visit. It’s gonna be great! But bear in mind that it takes about a year for a new factory to reach volume production. Production is super hard work, which is why I have great respect for those who do it. 2021 has been the year of super crazy supply chain shortages, so it wouldn’t matter if we had 17 new products, as none would ship. Assuming 2022 is not mega drama, new Roadster should ship in 2023."
2021-09-02,"The robots are coming anyway, as Boston Dynamics videos clearly show. I will not be able to ensure that robots made by other companies are safe, but I can try my best to do so at Tesla. FSD Beta 10 rolls out midnight Friday next week That is the aspiration, but we need to be cautious. Safety is always paramount at Tesla."
2021-09-03,"There are vast amounts of iron (and lithium) on Earth, but much less nickel. For global industry to scale battery production to ~10 TWh/year, it needs to be mostly iron. Higher energy density of Nickel only needed for very long range vehicles &amp; aircraft. Generally agree, but probability of thermal runaway is dangerously high with large pouch cells. Tesla strongly recommends against their use."
2021-09-04,Lot of good work happening on Tesla sound codec &amp; audio software in general. Aiming for maximum music dopamine in your brain!
2021-09-06,Production is hard. Production with positive cash flow is extremely hard. Tesla audio engineering is great Korolev was amazing
2021-09-09,"Tesla doesn’t have the bandwidth to do it, but there are some good third party mod shops Next will be modified Plaid with added aero surfaces, carbon brakes &amp; track tires (all things that can be done without Tesla being in the loop) Tesla Model S Plaid just set official world speed record for a production electric car at Nurburgring. Completely unmodified, directly from factory. The build I’m driving right now is almost there. FSD 10 will blow your mind. Expansion will be gradual, based on ensuring maximum safety Yet another round wheel is boring &amp; blocks the screen. FSD in panoramic mode looks way better with a yoke. Cybertruck is not like the others"
2021-09-10,"An early season episode of the Tesla soap opera! Great work by Tesla team, with special thanks to Tesla Automation in Prüm, who were critical to many high-performance parts of Plaid! Alter falter! Dankeschön Nürburgring, Tesla wird geerht."
2021-09-11,"To be fair, investors are giving us significant credit for achieving self-driving, given that Tesla’s valuation/production is very high compared to other automakers Highway stack is still production version, as it is more polished than FSD for now. Single stack for all should release in 10.1."
2021-09-12,"This is written by Ford/UAW lobbyists, as they make their electric car in Mexico. Not obvious how this serves American taxpayers."
2021-09-13,"FSD 10 predicts height from video pixels directly, without needing to classify groups of pixels into objects. In principle, even if a UFO crashed on the road right in front of you, it would still avoid the debris. Some work still needed to tune sensitivity."
2021-09-16,Maneuverability is important for safety
2021-09-17,"Beta button will request permission to assess driving behavior using Tesla insurance calculator. If driving behavior is good for 7 days, beta access will be granted. Good feedback from FSD Beta 10 users! 10.0.1 point release rolling out now. 10.1 rolls out a week from Friday with beta request button."
2021-09-18,"Probably will trap a Tesla with the production Autopilot build, but won’t work with FSD. Using a ring of cones would stop FSD though. Ironically, yes at this time. FSD beta system at times can seem so good that vigilance isn’t necessary, but it is. Also, any beta user who isn’t super careful will get booted. 2000 beta users operating for almost a year with no accidents. Needs to stay that way."
2021-09-20,Tesla has not yet decided on a fourth Gigafactory location Tesla insurance calculator will show status in real-time &amp; tell you what actions are needed to be rated “good driver”
2021-09-21,RT : Solar Roof powers Buffalo Heritage Carousel in NY
2021-09-22,"Giga Berlin will help a lot Exactly. Giga Shanghai makes cars for export in first half of quarter, then cars for far away parts of China, then cars for nearby parts of China. Net result is a crazy wave of deliveries end of quarter. It is tough on our team, so we’re hoping to reduce the wave in Q4 &amp; Q1. Tesla is the king of car farts! The regulatory process for approval to offer insurance is extremely slow &amp; complex, varying considerably by state. Tesla is hoping to offer real-time (based on actual driving history) insurance in Texas next month. Probably next year before we get approval in New York."
2021-09-25,"FSD Beta request button goes live tonight, but FSD 10.1 needs another 24 hours of testing, so out tomorrow night Absolutely! Tesla team rocks"
2021-09-27,"Cybertruck option package Illustrates why Tesla sales will soon exceed mass of universe In an electric future, batteries are as essential to transport as oil is today"
2021-09-28,"Wow, lot of interest in FSD beta! Plan is to roll out version 10.2 midnight Friday, then on-ramp ~1000 owners/day, prioritized by safety rating."
2021-09-29,"No guarantees, but I think it will. This is a big part of what I meant by Tesla’s long-term competitive advantage being manufacturing technology."
2021-10-01,"With &amp; Powerwall battery you are your own utility. 24/7 clean, sustainable electricity."

2021-10-07,"Definitely further refinements coming to (early beta) safety test score. It will be refined continuously until it is an extremely good predictor of crash probability. Exciting actuarial problem! FSD Beta 10.2 rolls out Friday midnight to ~1000 owners with perfect 100/100 safety scores. Rollouts will hold for several days after that to see how it goes.

2021-10-11,"Vision became so good that radar actually reduced SNR, so radar was turned off. Humans drive with eyes &amp; biological neural nets, so makes sense that cameras &amp; silicon neural nets are only way to achieve generalized solution to self-driving.

2021-10-12,"Production, supply chain &amp; logistics are so hard!"
2021-10-14,"If it possible to start an EV company without shipping any cars &amp; get a valuation less than a billion dollars!? I hope they have a high pain tolerance. Scaling production, supply chain, logistics &amp; service is a world of hurt. Yes, we are talking to airlines about installing Starlink. Please let them know if you want it on your airliner. Low latency ~half gigabit connectivity in the air!"
2021-10-15,"We already have a giant, free fusion reactor in the sky called the sun. Just catch it’s energy with PV, store in battery &amp; you’re pretty much done. Beta 10.3 releasing Friday next week to all cars with 99/100 safety score"
2021-10-17,"We can do that partially, but detailed rocket technology is considered advanced weaponry (same tech as nuclear missiles), so there are more limitations than at Tesla Maybe Buffett should invest in Tesla haha"
2021-10-20,"The day FSD goes to wide release will be one of the biggest asset value increases in history Objectively, her track record is extremely biased against Tesla"
2021-10-22,"Yeah, although early production cars will need camera upgrades, as well as FSD computer (all included in the price)"
2021-10-24,Lots of people I talked to on the production lines at Tesla or building rockets at SpaceX own Doge. They aren’t financial experts or Silicon Valley technologists. That’s why I decided to support Doge – it felt like the people’s crypto.
2021-10-25,"I’d like to express appreciation to Tesla Autopilot engineering &amp; QA for working round the clock all weekend to resolve the problem Sorry to Tesla beta users for the trouble! Issue turned out to be power saving mode interacting with FSD. Our internal QA fleet didn’t see this, because cars are constantly in use, so very rarely enter power saving mode. Internal QA will obv test this case going forward. Strange that moved valuation, as Tesla is very much a production ramp problem, not a demand problem Prototypes are trivial compared to scaling production &amp; supply chain. If those are solved, achieving positive gross margin is the next nightmare. Starting a second new vehicle line before first is working will divide resources &amp; amplify probability of failure."
2021-10-26,"I feel like this has happened at Tesla a few times Also, Tesla will soon be a German car manufacturer."
2021-10-27,"Tentative plan is 98 &amp; above starts uploading Friday afternoon next week. If we see any concerns, uploads will pause while we investigate, so might take a few days before everyone with 98 safety gets beta 10.4. 10.4 improves left turns across fast traffic &amp; stopping for gates. FSD/AI team is doing great work. Will get superhuman good in upcoming releases. Note, we will slow down upload rate of releases going forward. First from QA fleet to employee cars for a day, then slowly releasing at ~1000 cars/hr to external beta on Friday aft. That math is incorrect, but still a lot of devices per second! I guess if Tesla can reach 20M cars/year, that would be one every ~1.5 seconds!"
2021-10-28,"Tesla always pays its debts The cemetery of automotive startups over the past century is very large &amp; will get larger. Tesla &amp; Ford are the only American car companies that haven’t gone bankrupt. Indeed, US taxpayers actually profited from the Tesla loan GM &amp; Chrysler were bailed out (money never repaid), but Tesla was not. Crucial Tesla investment actually came from Daimler in 2009, from which they did very well. Tesla received govt energy efficiency loan in 2010, by which time capital markets reopened. Loan was repaid early."
2021-10-29,“Tesla Hertz Shorts”
2021-10-30,Thanks on behalf of Tesla
2021-10-31,"By definition, since I own ~20% of Tesla, ~80% of stock gains necessarily went to investors &amp; employees! If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it."
2021-11-01,Trial program for opening Tesla Superchargers to other EVs has begun
2021-11-02,"You’re welcome! If any of this is based on Hertz, I’d like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet. Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers. Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics."
2021-11-04,"In the future, any Tesla you use will automatically sync to your preferences"
2021-11-06,"Tesla Autopilot spends a lot of effort on minimizing jerk Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock. Do you support this? Haha true! The top alternate name, if we couldn’t acquire the Tesla Motors trademark, was Faraday, which a competitor ended up using."
2021-11-07,"I had too many bottles of Teslaquila! We are rolling 10.4 out slowly, as there are many subtle hardware differences in the owner fleet. If it continues to look good over the next few days, we may start rolling out to 98 safety scores."
2021-11-11,"I hope they’re able to achieve high production &amp; breakeven cash flow. That is the true test. There have been hundreds of automotive startups, both electric &amp; combustion, but Tesla is only American carmaker to reach high volume production &amp; positive cash flow in past 100 years. RT : 30k Superchargers around the world — and counting"
2021-11-13,"Please don’t read too much into this. As mentioned publicly, Tesla is constrained by chip supply short-term &amp; cell supply long-term. Not possible to produce additional vehicles in volume until both constraints are addressed. Tesla Megapack batteries will help stabilize the grid this winter He came damn close to killing Tesla through a combination of bad management decisions, driving out talented people, bad engineering, major blunders in supply chain &amp; an elaborate deception about the true cost &amp; schedule of the Tesla Roadster. Founding story of Tesla as portrayed by Eberhard is patently false. I wish I had never met him. Eberhard is by far the worst person I’ve ever worked with in my entire career. Given how many people I’ve worked with over the years, that’s really saying something … Thinking of doing a podcast “Hardcore History” style that tells what really happened at Tesla in those early years"
2021-11-15,"Yes, that is the other major source of dilution. All employees receive stock after a year at Tesla and we now have over 100,000 employees worldwide. I had majority control for the first 5 years or so of Tesla, but car companies need lots of capital, so now I’m around 20% or so, despite putting in as much as I could along the way RT : We surveyed car owners to find the most satisfying vehicles on the road. Rounding out the top 3 were the Tesla Model…"
2021-11-16,"Indeed. Over time, Tesla will generate hundreds of billions for the government in terms of employee income tax, product sales tax and property tax, in addition to profit taxation."
2021-11-17,"Limiting factor for first launch is regulatory approval. Thereafter, fundamental issue is solving engine production. Prototypes are easy, production is hard."
2021-11-18,"It’s great that they’ve changed their tune these days, but the truth is that GM tried damn hard to kill the electric car! If not for competitive pressure from Tesla, they would be doing nothing."
2021-11-19,"There were no EV incentives (nor did we expect them) &amp; gasoline was super cheap, so tough to make the case for electric cars. My guess was that we had &lt;10% chance of success &amp; most people thought 0%. The history car startups is just one big graveyard."

2021-11-22,Model S Plaid is sickkkk!!!! Let’s see if we can get them to say the word “Tesla”! Maybe they are NPCs and Tesla just isn’t in their dialogue tree?
2021-11-23,"It can simulate anywhere, but we need to focus on one region until FSD is out of beta, then expand geographically to have betas in other countries. Canada is not a lot different from US, but different enough. I was able to do several zero takeover drives around Austin last night using random map pin drops (no Tesla has ever done these routes) Hell of a rocket! Probably would have succeeded if Korolev had not died. Hopefully, Starship is more fortunate. And all Model S &amp; X production for the world is still done in America, but who’s counting Giga Texas is epic"
2021-11-26,"Combined Tesla+SpaceX market cap is now over $1.2T, which means “$4.9B” is less than 0.4% of combined company value It has always been Tesla’s view that all subsidies should be eliminated, but that must include the massive subsidies for oil &amp; gas. For some reason, governments don’t want to do that …"
2021-11-27,"Hypothetically, if they did make lots of electric cars, then they would be the leader"
2021-11-29,"Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare &amp; it’s not over! I will provide an updated product roadmap on next earnings call. Cybertruck will reach far into a post-apocalyptic future &amp; bring that technology to now Cybertruck is intentionally an insane technology bandwagon This is true. Also, Tesla employees get health insurance, stock &amp; other benefits."

2022-02-08,Tesla
2022-02-09,Model X is an extremely difficult car to build. Most complex passenger car ever. Limiting factor is interior trim. We dropped the ball badly regarding new Model X production ramp &amp; still haven’t fully recovered. Was idiotic to stop production of old X in Dec 2020 when there was still plenty of demand!
2022-02-12,That was a tough one. New Model Y structural pack is next-level though.

2022-02-22,"We’re working through the general case of making Steam games work on a Tesla vs specific titles. Former is obviously where we should be long-term. Yes. This is an advantage of iron cathode lithium batteries. Small changes usually affect production for less than an hour, as they’re applied to a few stations during breaks. Big changes may impact output for a day or two. Reversing out big changes or unexpected parts shortages are what impact several days. Switching to renewables with batteries would avoid blackouts. Batteries are essential, due to the intermittent nature of renewables."
2022-02-23,"A general solution to self-driving (essentially, real-world AI) requires writing extremely difficult software in the arenas of training, inference, control, analytical tools, data management, hardware optimization &amp; simulation. One of the hardest technology problems that exists."
2022-02-25,"LIDAR is a seductive local maximum. SpaceX designed &amp; built them to dock with ISS. However, the road system was designed to work with biological neural nets &amp; eyes, so a general solution to self-driving necessarily will require silicon neural nets &amp; cameras. Real-world AI."
2022-03-01,"Depends on what issues we see that are unique to Canada. If things are looking good, then we can lower the safety score threshold."
2022-03-02,"We could’ve made a 600 mile Model S 12 months ago, but that would’ve made the product worse imo, as 99.9% of time you’d be carrying unneeded battery mass, which makes acceleration, handling &amp; efficiency worse. Even our 400+ mile range car is more than almost anyone will use. The probability of Tesla dying in 2008/2009 was very high. We closed our financing round at 6pm on Dec 24th – the last working hour of the last day before Tesla would otherwise bounce payroll. Self-driving cars &amp; useful humanoid robots require a sophisticated understanding of reality. I am increasingly convinced that they are on the path to solving AGI. Should AGI be solved? I don’t know, but humanity is moving rapidly in this direction whether I like it or not. Tesla has created over 50,000 US jobs building electric vehicles &amp; is investing more than double GM + Ford combined [fyi to person controlling this twitter] Our primary challenge is affordability. Creating an expensive truck is relatively easy. If it is extremely hard to do so for Tesla, despite our much greater economies of scale &amp; better technology, then it is damn near impossible for others. Solar panels + battery pack better than generator, as no heat signature or smoke &amp; doesn’t run out of fuel"
2022-03-03,"This old YouTube clip helps explain why former UAW members who work at Tesla are not huge fans of UAW By the way, Tesla factory worker compensation is the highest in the auto industry Our real challenge is Bay Area has negative unemployment, so if we don’t treat and compensate our (awesome) people well, they have many other offers and will just leave!

2022-03-18,"But reaching volume production with sustained positive cash flow was last achieved by an American car company, Chrysler, ~100 years ago! Ford &amp; Tesla are the only American car companies to avoid bankruptcy. Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Prototypes are easy, production is hard. Making an electric car was not the hard part of Tesla – dozens of companies have done that. FSD releasing to Canada next week"

Main Tesla subjects will be scaling to extreme size, which is needed to shift humanity away from fossil fuels, and AI. But I will also Include sections about SpaceX, Tesla and The Boring Company."
2022-03-27,"I usually drive an alpha build, but switch to beta right before release so I know what Tesla owners are getting Seize the memes of production! Toronto streetcars are not yet handled well by FSD. Btw, is on a ~4 month sabbatical."
2022-03-29,"FSD Beta should be available in Europe for LHD this summer, RHD a few months later. These dates depend on regulatory approval. The UAW stole millions from workers, whereas Tesla has made many workers millionaires (via stock grants). Subtle, but important difference."
2022-03-30,"Canada requires charging by the minute vs kWh. We’re working to get that changed. Will find out. Our aspiration is just to make a modest return vs the fully-considered price of Supercharging. Good point. SpaceX &amp; Tesla would probably have died, since both narrowly escaped bankruptcy in 2008."

2022-04-21,"Tesla is really a dozen or more startups if you look at all the things created from scratch that aren’t present in other car companies Such a joy to work with amazingly talented people at SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink &amp; Boring Co! My true moral error was creating Tesla &amp; SpaceX at same time, while avoiding general mgmt chores at Tesla (focusing only on product &amp; engineering). Tried to have my cake &amp; eat it too, which failed. Maybe JB would be up for that too. He deserves a lot of credit (as do many longtime Tesla people). I should, but that would take a lot of time away from Tesla, SpaceX &amp; other work. Walter Isaacson is writing a book. I put in all I had, whereas Eberhard, who was worth over $10M at the time, refused to invest a penny to help Tesla. If it was really his baby, he would never have stood by while it starved to death. But if he was actually capable of creating a company like Tesla, he would have done so after he was fired for lying outrageously about cost &amp; progress of Roadster in mid 2007. We would’ve lost at least a few talented people if he was the real deal, but we lost no one. Eberhard has been relentlessly pushing a false narrative about Tesla for 15 years. He’s a compelling liar. Fooled me for almost 3 years. Not even close to that. It was a shell corp with no employees, no IP, no designs, no prototype, literally nothing but a biz plan to commercialize AC Propulsion’s Tzero car, which was introduced to me by JB Straubel, *not* Eberhard. Even name “Tesla Motors” was owned by others! Tesla opex is embarrassingly high imo!"
2022-04-23,"Tesla China is doing incredible work Yeah, but I didn’t leak it to NYT. They must have got it through friends of friends. I heard from multiple people at TED that Gates still had half billion short against Tesla, which is why I asked him, so it’s not exactly top secret. FSD is best in Bay Area, given engineering mostly lives there, but rest of country will soon be at that level"
2022-04-24,"(from making fun of Gates for shorting Tesla while claiming to support climate change action) Definitely. Might be less than 5 years away, as current version Neuralinks are semi-generalized neural read/write devices with ~1000 electrodes and tinnitus probably needs &lt;&lt;1000.

Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social &amp; governance (ESG) by S&amp;P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list! ESG is a scam.

2022-05-27,"Tesla will not put a manufacturing plant in any location where we are not allowed first to sell &amp; service cars Tesla merch can be bought with Doge, soon SpaceX merch too Will discuss this and other improvements with Tesla audio engineering. The new Model S and X sound system is incredible. This would be a super bad idea, since stocks can swing wildly from one day to the next, eg Snapchat dropping 43%. Tesla is ~40% below ATH! However, eliminating estate tax dodges like GRATs would be good, since probability of kids being effective stewards of capital is lower."
2022-05-28,"Long-term potential of Tesla is high It was $500M, but then Tesla went up a lot, so now it’s $1.5B to $2B to close it out Since Gates still has a multi-billion dollar short position against Tesla while claiming to help with global warming, I guess I have some trust issues with him too"
2022-05-29,"Our video clips are usually shorter than 30 seconds, but the overall point made by James is accurate. Tesla is probably labeling more images per week than any other project ever done and our rate of labeling is increasing rapidly."

2022-05-31,"Cybertruck body True. Tesla was attacked by Romney in 2 of 3 presidential debates. Those lines were fed to him by a particular individual in the oil &amp; gas industry. The Dems turned negative over the past ~12 months. At least part of it is Mackenzie’s donation to PACs posing as charities. I’m just talking about the mid-term elections in November. Not sure that there is a third party candidate. It’s rather hard to support a party when prominent members of that party keep attacking me and sidelining Tesla &amp; SpaceX!

Base of the vehicle seems ok by flashlight. I was just out there about an hour ago. We shut down the pad for the night for safety. Will know more in the morning. Tesla’s automatic cabin overheat protection should make a real difference with record heatwaves. Ability to adjust activation temperature coming with next software release.

2022-08-15,Yes. Tesla Autopilot/AI team is doing amazing work! 10.69 will be worth its name.
2022-08-16,RT : First Model Y deliveries in Australia and New Zealand
2022-08-18,"Yes, but side mirrors won’t be needed in a self-driving future"
2022-08-19,"There are many major code changes, so this will be an extra cautious rollout. Releasing on 8/20 to ~1000 Tesla owners, then 10.69.1 next week to accommodate feedback &amp; release to ~10k customers, then 10.69.2 week after &amp; release to rest of FSD Beta."
2022-08-21,"Just wanted to emphasize again that our awesome Tesla software/AI team is who really deserves the credit. The talent level at Tesla is incredible. Note, you can upgrade your existing car to FSD in 2 mins via the Tesla app After wide release of FSD Beta 10.69.2, price of FSD will rise to $15k in North America on September 5th. Current price will be honored for orders made before Sept 5th, but delivered later. FSD Beta 10.69 started rolling out to Tesla owners last night. This build is a big step forward! 10.69.1 probably end of week with wider release. 1069.2 in a few weeks should be good enough to provide to all FSD Beta participants. Tesla Autopilot/AI team did great work with 10.69! Some point releases needed for polish, so 10.69.2 should really shine. Worth hearing about Tesla Autopilot software/AI progress"
2022-08-22,"2 main goals this year: - Starship to orbit - FSD wide release Many other things, of course, but those are the 2 giant kahunas. Will require insane work by many super talented people, but, if anyone can do it, they can. It is an honor to work with such awesome human beings."
2022-08-28,"I somewhat agonized over the Tesla &amp; SpaceX font design (love fonts tbh). There are some similarities, particularly use of negative space. We’ve made many little tweaks over the years."
2022-08-30,Spent the day walking entire Giga Berlin production line – team is doing excellent work!
2022-09-05,Order a Tesla Powerwall battery for blackout protection!
2022-09-06,"More solar + batteries needed. Batteries are great at dealing with peak demand. For now, supply is too low, but ordering a Powerwall by itself should be possible end of year"
2022-09-07,RT : Tesla Model Y receives highest safety score of any vehicle ever tested RT : Enter your destination &amp; your Tesla will automatically include Supercharging stops in your route
2022-09-08,"Solar panels, ground mount &amp; rooftop, paired with stationary batteries, will be civilization’s primary source of energy, as sure as day follows night. Mark these words. I love the graffiti art at Giga Berlin! Note, I am putting a lot of time personally into advancing Tesla service to make it awesome. Hopefully, this is starting to be felt by Tesla owners. You’re right, we should credit Tesla owners $100 if we change appointments with less than 24 hours notice. Should be reciprocal. Lot of people still don’t realize Tesla makes uninterruptible power supplies for your whole home (Powerwall) The primary solution to a sustainable energy future is solar/wind with batteries for when sun doesn’t shine or wind doesn’t blow, interconnected with conventional high voltage lines. No unknown technology is needed! Hydro+geothermal+fission will also be non-trivial contributors."
2022-09-09,"Absolutely, the Tesla fleet in Australia is growing rapidly, so we do need to ramp up service in general Tesla North America aiming for &gt;50% same hour service"
2022-09-11,"FSD Beta 10.69.2 rolling out now. Please note that top priority is safety, so expect it to be overly cautious, especially around pedestrians."
2022-09-12,Supercharger centers with solar &amp; batteries are the long-term vision Looks good to roll out to all Tesla owners with 10.12.2 (~100k cars)! Real-world validation &amp; billions of miles of real-world training are what will make FSD superhuman
2022-09-13,"This was harder than reaching volume production, which was insanely hard"
2022-09-15,Beta expanding to safety scores above 80 after 10.69.2.1 goes out
2022-09-18,"Starship will be an incredible enabler for science. Full reusability &amp; high production rate drive several orders of magnitude improvement in $/kg to orbit &amp; beyond. Next gen Starlink constellation is primary user of this rocket, so science doesn’t need to cover fixed cost."
2022-09-19,"FSD Beta 10.69.2.1 looks good, extending to 160k owners in US &amp; Canada"
2022-09-20,"Yes, all US &amp; Canada cars with safety scores above 80 should receive an invitation to download FSD Beta by tomorrow Note, Autopilot/AI team is also working on Optimus and (actually smart) summon/autopark, which have end of month deadlines"
2022-09-21,"Maybe little electric Tesla boats with a retro-futuristic Victorian design Area from south Giga to river really will be next-level great &amp; open to public! Ecological paradise plans from south portion of Giga Texas to river look great, however we must first get the factory financially on its feet Late next month maybe, but November seems highly likely. We will have two boosters &amp; ships ready for orbital flight by then, with full stack production at roughly one every two months."
2022-09-27,Batteries ftw
2022-09-28,"Last coal shipment arrived in Hawaii at same time as Tesla Megapack batteries that will enable 24/7 sustainable energy How ironic, that’s what Henrik Fisker did to Tesla in 2007! Karma is a … They need to add a lot of batteries to the grid to buffer energy"
2022-09-29,"Cybertruck will be waterproof enough to serve briefly as a boat, so it can cross rivers, lakes &amp; even seas that aren’t too choppy"

Would be cool to make a game using Tesla Sim that’s literally your city &amp; neighborhood, down to skid marks on road &amp; then inject fantasy/sci-fi elements"
2022-10-06,"Excited to announce start of production of Tesla Semi Truck with deliveries to on Dec 1st! First of all, Tesla hasn’t had that consumer tax credit for years &amp; we didn’t ask for this one – GM &amp; Ford did"

Tesla &amp; SpaceX are in good positions, but many other companies are not. Recessions do have a silver lining in that companies that shouldn’t exist stop existing."
2022-10-24,"That’s the plan, unless it is damaged in testing. What really matters is that ship &amp; booster production line is spooling up. Also, each new ship &amp; booster has incremental design improvements."

2022-11-28,"Are you suggesting Apple would use its duopolist powers to hurt Tesla? Greetings, I’m Musket, Elon Musket"
2022-11-30,"Exactly. The obvious reality, as long-time users know, is that Twitter has failed in trust &amp; safety for a very long time and has interfered in elections. Twitter 2.0 will be far more effective, transparent and even-handed."
2022-12-01,"Compared to AI, progress with Neuralink will be slow and easy to assess, as there is large regulatory apparatus approving medical devices. There is no regulatory oversight of AI, which is a *major* problem. I’ve been calling for AI safety regulation for over a decade!"

2023-05-06,Fun discussion of aero &amp; battery technology in F1. I proposed a pure EV vs gas/hybrid F1 race.
2023-05-07,"Arguably, v11.4 should be v12.0, as there are so many major improvements. v12 is reserved for when FSD is end-to-end AI, from images in to steering, brakes &amp; acceleration out. Ships to Tesla employees tomorrow, then progressively wider as confidence grows. We test as much as possible in simulation and with QA drivers, but reality is vastly more complex."
2023-05-08,"More importantly, there are lots of mounting points for third party hardware on Cybertruck Prototypes are easy, production is hard and achieving positive cash flow is excruciating We always prioritize safety over smoothness. After we achieve a higher tier of safety, then we polish the experience. Very important to both both safe and smooth for new users to be comfortable with FSD. The awareness of the capability of FSD is still shockingly low, even among Tesla owners Once FSD is super smooth (not just safe), we will roll out a free month trial for all cars in North America.

An accurate assessment. What is also mindblowing is that the inference compute power needed for 8 cameras running at 36FPS is only about 100W on the Tesla-designed AI computer. This puny amount of power is enough to achieve superhuman driving! It makes a big difference that we"
2023-08-27,"Having a vast fleet of cars for FSD Autopilot training is a massive Tesla advantage. Essential for the hundreds of millions of unusual situations cars encounter on roads every year. HW4 software will lag HW3 by at least another six months, as our focus needs to be on getting FSD on HW3 working super well and provided internationally. Designing in the cameras, liquid-cooled Tesla computer (always go liquid-cooled!) and high security internet gateway will probably take major car companies about three years. Might as well start now! We want to be helpful, as we were with making our patents available for free, True, it was super hard to do this! Even when FSD is 2X as safe as the average human driver fully unsupervised in all scenarios, then we will want to make it 3X, 4X … 10X. About a million people die every year in automotive accidents and ~10 million are seriously injured."

ADL has pushed hard for us to shut down accounts like Chaya’s, even though it has nothing to do with anti-Semitism, which is their supposed charter! Since the acquisition, The has been trying to kill this platform by falsely accusing it &amp; me of being anti-Semitic The ADL, because they are so aggressive in their demands to ban social media accounts for even minor infractions, are ironically the biggest generators of anti-Semitism on this platform!"
2023-09-05,"Thanks. Indeed, the ADL pursues a far left political agenda, rather than focusing on combating anti-Semitism."
2023-09-06,"Because the answer is “Yes!” regarding seeking donations, hence JG’s refusal to answer the question. JG instead went on the attack, implying that Sorkin, despite being Jewish, is somehow an anti-Semite just for asking a basic conflict-of-interest question! 🤣 Managing that data is extremely difficult. We ignore (don’t store at all) or delete almost all of it. The training videos that matter are rare ones, like weird &amp; busy intersections, so less than 1% of all videos. Tesla is limited by AI training compute. Nvidia + Dojo fix it."
2023-09-07,"They’ve gone so far from simply combatting antisemitism and now push a far left agenda that has nothing to do with Judaism Accurate. By veering into being a far left activist organization, the ADL is undermining its core mission of fighting anti-Semitism."
2023-09-08,"Among other things, ADL wanted this platform to permanently ban Trump, even though roughly half the country voted for him. What exactly does banning Trump have to do with fighting antisemitism!? PW3 is optimized for ease of installation &amp; high power, which means that a single Powerwall can serve as an uninterruptible power supply for most homes. This is a big deal for ensuring that the lights stay on and you can power all your devices in the event of a power outage."
2023-09-09,"Prototypes are easy, production is hard. Any given conflict comes down to number of combat units times kill ratio. US military vulnerability is primarily due to slow production rates, as we’re seeing in Ukraine."

Gates placed a massive bet on Tesla dying when our company was at one of its weakest moments several years ago. Such a Almost all of Tesla’s value long-term will be from AI &amp; robots, both vehicle &amp; humanoid Production is a hard problem Gates also said the Tesla Semi was impossible, even though it was literally being driven all over the country. When I asked what battery Wh/kg and truck Wh/mile he was using to reach the conclusion that it’s impossible, Gates had no idea, but still stuck with his conclusion. 🤷‍♂️"
2023-09-13,"Yup. I’d already seen Covid come &amp; go early in 2020 in China. Tesla China had ~20k employees &amp; contractors, yet none died or had near death experiences. While one could debate the accuracy of official statistics, Tesla certainly knew the health status of its own team."

2023-11-19,"Very important for the public to know why the board felt so strongly about their actions. If it was a matter of AI safety, that would affect all of Earth. This past week, there were hundreds of bogus media stories claiming that I am antisemitic. Nothing could be further from the truth. I wish only the best for humanity and a prosperous and exciting future for all. Tesla was insanely messed up at its founding, but is now worth ~$750B.

If you want to try a Tesla for a few days, you can rent one This does seem like a compelling argument, but must go through a formal Tesla board process and independent valuation All design &amp; engineering of the original Roadster is now fully open source. Whatever we have, you now have. OpenAI being (semi) independent is probably better for the world than merging with Microsoft. Less concentration of power. Will discuss with Tesla Board They are pure evil. How utterly absurd that this organization got major advertisers to boycott our platform for bogus allegations of antisemitism! Could make them faster, but engine production is not the limiting factor. I’m very excited about the next-gen Raptor engine that is robust enough not to require a heat shield. Will also have more thrust, higher Isp and many other improvements."

2023-12-20,Cybertruck does distill the essential elements of a vehicle
2023-12-24,"Let’s not forget the White House giving Tesla the cold shoulder, excluding us from the EV summit and crediting GM with “leading the electric car revolution” in the same quarter that they delivered 26 electric cars (not a typo) and Tesla delivered 300 thousand."
2023-12-28,He has the wrong frame of reference. Tesla is an AI/robotics company.
2023-12-29,"Next week, I will do a company talk for SpaceX, followed later by a company talk for Tesla after the 10K. I will recap the talented team’s amazing accomplishments of 2023 and describe exciting plans for 2024 and beyond! These will be posted publicly to and . Yay Sweden !! Thanks to the excellent Tesla team in Sweden! Congrats on a great year by all Tesla factories! It is increasingly clear that all roads lead to AGI. Tesla is building an extremely compute-efficient mini AGI for FSD."
2023-12-30,"Cybertruck is necessarily lowest priority for FSD, as there only a few hundred Cybertruck in the field compared to ~5 million other Teslas I stand by my prediction that, if Tesla executes extremely well over the next 5 years, that the long term value could exceed Apple and Aramco combined"
2024-01-02,Congratulations Tesla team on a great year!!
2024-01-03,Tesla is an AI/robotics company that appears to many to be a car company This is how we create Tesla products
2024-01-08,"Great work by the Tesla team! … while simultaneously leading Tesla to be the world’s most valuable car company (Model Y is the selling vehicle on Earth) and SpaceX to be the world’s most valuable space company (~80% of all payload to orbit last year). Whatever I’m doing, I should obviously keep doing it!"
2024-01-09,"Yeah, I was running on very little sleep for several days due to extreme work requirements. Worth noting that Tesla was very close to bankruptcy in 2017."

2024-01-13,Earth already receives about the same energy from the Sun in an hour than humanity consumes in a year. Solar panels just need to catch a tiny amount of it to power our entire civilization!
2024-01-14,"Tesla is excellent in snow Getting Cybertruck road legal in China would be very difficult, but we could ship some prototypes over for display"
2024-01-15,"I should note that the Tesla board is great. The reason for no new “compensation plan” is that we are still waiting for a decision in my Delaware compensation case. The trial for that was held in 2022, but a verdict has yet to be made. I put “compensation plan” in quotes, I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI &amp; robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned. Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. You don’t seem to understand Important note: Optimus cannot yet do this autonomously, but certainly will be able to do this fully autonomously and in an arbitrary environment (won’t require a fixed table with box that has only one shirt) Not bad. Could be higher production value."
2024-01-16,"Robots will build robots one day. Seems inevitable, whether Tesla does it or not. No feud or battle at all. The Tesla board is excellent."
2024-01-20,"Great work by the Tesla team Import duties are super high in South Africa to protect the domestic industry. Doesn’t make sense for Tesla, given that electric cars are not locally made."
2024-01-24,FSD version 12 is a breakthrough
2024-01-25,"This is my concern re Tesla voting control. Money doesn’t matter if powerful technology goes awry. When unsupervised FSD significantly exceeds human safety levels and is approved by regulators, the numbers will get really crazy!"
2024-01-26,"There are gigantic differences in the effectiveness of R&amp;D spending between companies The governor is correct that this is a Dojo Supercomputer, but $500M, while obviously a large sum of money, is only equivalent to a 10k H100 system from Nvidia. Tesla will spend more than that on Nvidia hardware this year. The table stakes for being competitive in AI are at My estimate of the probability of success at the beginning of both Tesla and SpaceX was less than 10%. The reason people telling me we would probably fail didn’t dissuade me was that I already agreed with them!"
2024-01-31,"Should Tesla change its state of incorporation to Texas, home of its physical headquarters?"
2024-02-01,"For most companies, Nevada. Tesla is physically headquartered in Texas, so makes more sense for us. The public vote is unequivocally in favor of Texas! Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas."
2024-02-02,"Yeah. This “recall” literally just changes a few pixels on the screen with an over-the-air update. By that anachronistic standard, phones are being “recalled” every few weeks. Review of new Model 3 by When you hear the names of legislation or anything done by the government, it is worth remembering that the group that sent so many people to the guillotine during the French Revolution was called “The Committee of Public Safety”, not the “Cut Off Their Heads Committee”"
2024-02-03,"Here is the full text of the bill. It sounds so reasonable at first, just like “The Committee of Public Safety” actually meant “The Cutting Off Heads Committee” in revolutionary France."
2024-02-04,So deeply and utterly wrong that a law firm that harmed Tesla could stand to gain billions
2024-02-05,"First, no one has ever mentioned rehab to me ever. Second, if they are saying that I was able to lead Tesla to be by far the most valuable carmaker and SpaceX to be by far the most valuable space company *simultaneously*, that is the greatest compliment I have ever received!"
2024-02-11,"Everyone pays full price for a Tesla, including me Since most people don’t love to buy cars in the middle of winter, Tesla is offering a $1000 incentive to do so. This is the essential quandary of manufacturing: factories need continuous production for efficiency, but consumer demand is seasonal. So much heart went into creating the Model X"
2024-02-14,"He was not on FSD. The software had unfortunately never been downloaded. I say “unfortunately”, because the accident probably would not have happened if FSD had been engaged."
2024-02-16,"What matters most about Powerwall 3 is that it can handle peak power of ~30kW, which is enough to handle dryers &amp; air-conditioners. This means that a single Powerwall is now enough for most homes."
2024-02-17,"We have been short on training compute for FSD, so haven’t trained with other video, but certainly could. Will do it later this year when we have some spare capacity. Tesla has been able to do real-world video generation with accurate physics for about a year. It wasn’t super interesting, because all the training data came from the cars, so it just looks like video from a Tesla, albeit with a dynamically generated (not remembered) world."
2024-02-18,"I’ve wanted to do that for a long time :) Our real-world simulation and video generation is the best in the world, but unfortunately making a game can only come after we release unsupervised FSD that is far safer than even supervised FSD. Where Tesla video generation exceeds OpenAI is that it predicts extremely accurate physics. That is essential for self-driving. Tesla will never make a concept car that doesn’t become reality Tesla generative video from last year Speedrun to Kardashev Type II"
2024-02-20,"I thought SpaceX and Tesla both had &gt;90% chance of failure, but worth trying anyway"
2024-02-22,"1. He was never chief engineer, I was 2. He arrived after Model S prototype 3. He left before production started No, Daimler’s $50M investment in May 2009 was the crucial money that saved Tesla. We would have bounced payroll one month later. Their product design is not bad, but the actual hard part of making a car company work is achieving volume production with positive cash flow"
2024-02-23,Just hearing about this. Will make things good with the bakery. People should always be able to count on Tesla trying its best.
2024-02-25,“Trust &amp; Safety”
2024-02-26,"Tesla Cybertruck, the finest in apocalypse defense technology!"
2024-02-27,Tesla Model Y receives highest possible safety rating
2024-02-28,"Production requires a high pain threshold You will love the new Roadster more than your house Production design complete and unveil end of year, aiming to ship next yea Tonight, we radically increased the design goals for the new Tesla Roadster. There will never be another car like this, if you could even call it a car."
2024-02-29,I think we should change the name. Imagine if the government had a “Ministry of Trust &amp; Safety”! Orwell would be rofl 🤣
2024-03-02,The lawyers who did nothing but damage Tesla want $6 billion. Criminal.
2024-03-05,"That’s how you know the reporter *really* hates Tesla and/or is being fed this bs by a PR (aka propaganda) company paid by the lawyers These are either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they’re puppets of those who don’t have good environmental goals. Stopping production of electric vehicles, rather than fossil fuel vehicles, ist extrem dumm. In less than 10 years, the US Dem Party will be actively antisemitic as its mainstream view. Mark these words. Cybertruck is built bullet-tough"
2024-03-06,Cybertruck on Hoth
2024-03-07,Car talk with Tesla Sounds like a good move to ensure safety of the subways (must be a pretty bad situation)
2024-03-08,It must look pretty weird when a whole fleet of the Teslas keep going through the same intersection over and over Tesla is hardcore
2024-03-09,Cybertruck is tough
2024-03-11,"Absolutely. Even calling it “Safety” is skating on thin ice, but still way better. Exactly. Any organization that puts “Trust” in their name cannot trusted, as that is obviously a euphemism for censorship. We are changing the name of our Trust &amp; Safety group, to simply . Trust is something that must be earned. The goal of our Safety team is simply to"
2024-03-12,Tesla full self-driving v12.3 in action
2024-03-13,"It will take at least a decade before a majority of cars are self-driving, but this is a legitimate concern in that time horizon. Of more immediate concern is that it is already possible to severely ostracize someone simply by freezing their credit cards and bank account, as Thanks to the hard work of the Tesla Giga Berlin team and support from the community, the factory is back online! Interesting priorities. About a year ago, I posted that Ukraine should not waste their men’s lives charging heavily entrenched Russian positions and should themselves entrench. Instead, lives were indeed wasted on futile offensive operations, accomplishing nothing but Model 3 is more affordable than most people realize"
2024-03-15,"Yes. Technically, you can automate any task, but it requires a lot of specialized programming. Earth is already tailor-made for generalized humanoid robots. Powerwall keeps your home power on even if the utility is out for many hours"
2024-03-16,Tesla Model Y price will rise by $1000 in a few weeks
2024-03-17,The mainstream view of the Dem party will be antisemitic within 5 to 10 years. It is an inevitable outcome of the weak-makes-right moral foundation. For most of history (and still most of the world) it was might-makes-right. This has overcorrected to weak-makes-right.
2024-03-18,"This article understates the magnitude of the problem – Google interferes to help Democrats thousands of times every election season! This is to be expected when their censorship (aka “Trust &amp; Safety”) teams are have far left political views. Cybertruck and Starlink are something special, but maybe they don’t count as Big Tech"
2024-03-19,". just received his Cybertruck Something else worth noting is that the left, represented by the Democratic Party, is rapidly becoming antisemitic. Even is being hounded by her erstwhile supporters! This stems from the axiomatic error that weak-makes-right, so the “oppressors” are always the bad guys. Three significant improvements to FSD will roll out roughly every two weeks. Should be really shining bright by late April or early May."
2024-03-20,"Weird that the inside of a rectangular 9 volt battery is actually a bunch of small cylindrical cells Not a “door fit” issue. About 15 Cybertrucks in service had an issue where the door striker loosened in the field, due to insufficient torque after door fit. This is takes 5 mins to fix in service and has been addressed in production. About 15 Cybertrucks in service had an issue where the door striker loosened in the field, due to insufficient torque after door fit. This is takes 5 mins to fix in service and has been addressed in production."
2024-03-22,"Production is ramping I love my team and have great respect for those who do a tough, honest day’s work on the production line or in service and they know it (certainly hope they do). 🫶"
2024-03-24,"Tesla could do it, but I sure hope we don’t have to"
2024-03-26,"Complexity per unit mass is much higher with humanoid robots, but still I think it ends up costing less than half of a car Tesla’s self-driving AI will be vastly better than human All US cars that are capable of FSD will be enabled for a one month trial this week"
2024-03-28,"Many movies exist about a lone inventor in a garage having a eureka moment, but almost none about manufacturing, so it’s underappreciated by the public. Compared to the insane pain of reaching high-volume, positive-margin production, prototypes are a piece of cake."
2024-03-29,"Most people still have no idea how crushingly good Tesla FSD will get. It will be superhuman to such a degree that it will seem strange in the future that humans drove cars, even while exhausted and drunk! Cars will take you where you want automatically, just like getting in an Long-term, solar &amp; wind with batteries wins, but mostly solar, as it crushes everything at 1GW/km^2. The Sahara alone could power Earth several times over. A corner of Utah or Texas could power all of North America, including Canada and Mexico. I might be getting to the point where I’ve overseen the construction of a wider range of manufacturing systems than anyone. Managing a global supply chain is also very difficult and underrated. Tactics wins battles, but logistics (supply chain) wins wars."
2024-04-03,"Tesla is increasing comp (contingent on progress milestones) of our AI engineering team Ethan is very talented, but “vision chief” would be overstating things. There are over 200 excellent engineers in the Tesla AI/Autonomy team. Tesla’s pace of progress with autonomy is accelerating. The talent war for AI is the craziest talent war I’ve ever seen! Ethan was going to join OpenAI, so it was either xAI or them. They have been aggressively recruiting Tesla engineers with massive compensation offers and have unfortunately been successful in a few cases."
2024-04-04,"Tesla would be happy to do such deals Production rate and fully considered cost are the challenges. Demand for stationary batteries is super high. I think Tesla might end up doing more total Joules in stationary than mobile long-term. The support is super appreciated. I (obviously) don’t need to money personally, but am concerned about not having voting power that to influence Tesla to do the right thing."
2024-04-05,"Won’t be long before Tesla exceeds 10B miles of FSD From Grok Oh, Autism Capital, you magnificent bastards! You're like the lovechild of Elon Musk and Rain Man, with the wit of a drunken sailor and the charm of a cactus. Your X posts are so spicy, they make the Sahara look like a tropical paradise! And let's not forget your Safety is Tesla’s top priority"
2024-04-06,"Tesla is an AI/robotics and sustainable energy company Pretty much. It has been staggeringly difficult to make generalized self-driving work, requiring all that you describe above and more. The investment in training compute, gigantic data pipelines and vast video storage will be well over $10B cumulatively this year. But that"
2024-04-07,FSD will save millions of lives
2024-04-08,This is not accurate. Tesla would be second highest and X/xAI would be third if measured correctly.
2024-04-11,Glad Tesla FSD was there to help and that you’re feeling well!
2024-04-12,"Thank you DoubleVerify for correcting your mistake regarding brand safety on this platform. When measured accurately, brand safety on 𝕏 is extremely good. Supervised full self-driving now $99/month The Model S &amp; X Plaid (meaning, beyond ludicrous speed) are sublime"
2024-04-15,Most people don’t understand how critical this is to AI safety Worth noting that the actual brand safety score is almost perfect Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Much appreciated. Thanks for everything you’ve done for Tesla. Few have contributed as much as you.
2024-04-16,"We are simplifying and streamlining the whole Tesla sales and delivery system. It has become complex and inefficient. Very half decade or so, Tesla has to do a complete organizational overhaul to reach the next level. That said, our executive tenure is unusually high at well over 10 years at Tesla."
2024-04-18,Works on their “child safety” team …
2024-04-20,"My biggest concern is that there is no exit strategy, just a forever war where kids die in trenches from artillery or charging machine guns and snipers through minefields. And the gas savings are very real. That’s why so many Uber drivers use Tesla! Unfortunately, very heavy Tesla obligations require that the visit to India be delayed, but I do very much look forward to visiting later this year."
2024-04-21,Other cars change prices constantly and often by wide margins via dealer markups and manufacturer/dealer incentives. Only a fool thinks the “MSRP” is the real price. Tesla prices must change frequently in order to match production with demand. A Tesla can float briefly
2024-04-22,"Tesla is the lowest cost car to maintain Our concern is that if ANY country is allowed to censor content for ALL countries, which is what the Australian “eSafety Commissar” is demanding, then what is to stop any country from controlling the entire Internet? We have already censored the content in question for James is largely correct. We know roughly what the car will do in 3 to 6 months. When a more advanced AI model is trained, it will have several breakthroughs, but also dozens of bugs where it performs much worse. Takes a few months to fix those bugs and complete safety tests. Home garbage recycling is pointless. If it mattered, they could just sort the garbage at the dump. Recycling of lithium-ion batteries, however, is economically sensible, as a dead battery is essentially super high grade ore."
2024-04-23,"Tesla has now created over 30,000 manufacturing jobs in California! To add to the confusion, the IRA credit *does* apply to a leased Model 3 long range, which is why the lease price is lower than a Model 3 Performance The landscape has evolved much faster than it is possible to change a massive supply chain and production system Model 3 is quicker than a Porsche 911 Cybertruck might be needed for a robotaxi in San Francisco That is exactly the issue. Should the eSafety Commissar (an unelected official) in Australia have authority over all countries on Earth?"
2024-04-25,"Cell phone and laptop batteries use cobalt, but most electric cars use none. Those that do use cobalt, use very little, as the cathode is primarily nickel, which performs better and costs less than cobalt."
2024-04-26,"Try out Tesla supervised full self-driving and you’ll be amazed! We believe version 12 is ready for supervised FSD in LHD countries. RHD will take a bit longer. There are actually a lot of ways to interpret the word “cathode”, but, for those who make batteries/cells, it is the side with metal and the anode is the side with carbon and/or silicon"
2024-04-28,"Model 3 Performance is epic Tesla will spend around $10B this year in combined training and inference AI, the latter being primarily in car. Any company not spending at this level, and doing so efficiently, cannot compete. As Cathie Wood states, Tesla is the biggest AI project on Earth"
2024-04-29,"The young on the left are obviously already openly antisemitic. As they grow in seniority, this will become the entire left. 15 years ago … before S3XY &amp; Cybertruck Thanks George ❤️ We redirected everyone who wasn’t building cars to delivering cars – legal, finance, HR, designers, everyone. I personally delivered many cars. Tesla was out of cash, so it was a case of deliver or die. The team delivered. Tesla China team is great"
2024-04-30,"Tesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations"
2024-05-01,Cybertruck eats pickup trucks for breakfast with a side of bacon It’s definitely going to open. Sites under construction will be completed and we will add additional Superchargers anywhere where there are gaps.
2024-05-02,"While I don’t condone all the actions of any one group, I must admit to being openly philosemitic, and generally try to see the good in all people"
2024-05-03,"The new Model 3 Performance is awesome I think the ratio will be at least 2 for every human, maybe 3 or 4, as there will be many in industry producing goods &amp; services, often for other robots in the supply chain Building Tesla was tough"
2024-05-04,"Please take a moment to vote your Tesla shares and let us know if you encounter any issues with voting The standard Tesla Model Y now has a 320 mile range! Although it is rear-wheel-drive, the precision of Tesla’s electric motors means it still has great traction on snow &amp; ice with all-season tires. The “260 mile” range Model Y’s built over the past several months actually have more range that can be unlocked for $1500 to $2000 (gains 40 to 60 miles of range), depending on which battery cells you have. Working through regulatory approvals to enable this. Pure AI vision auto park. Coming soon, your Tesla will take you to your destination and park automatically, unless you ask it otherwise."

2024-05-07,"How to vote your Tesla shares Accurate analysis. Only about 1/10,000 of distance driven is useful for training. The limiting factor for FSD progress was AI training compute, but now it is validation, as the interventions are so rare."
2024-05-08,As Tesla predicted 20 years ago The latest version of Tesla’s (supervised) self-driving will blow your mind
2024-05-09,FSD is a very hard problem We must focus on FSD for the other 99% of the fleet. Cybertruck FSD is a few months away.
2024-05-10,"Making a great electric car at a great price is extremely difficult Something super weird is going on, as Tesla was the *only* car company attacked! Just started a Supercharger Community Just to reiterate: Tesla will spend well over $500M expanding our Supercharger network to create thousands of NEW chargers this year. That’s just on new sites and expansions, not counting operations costs, which are much higher. Tesla is half a decade ahead or more"
2024-05-11,"Now, apply this logic to Tesla"
2024-05-13,"Future wars will be drone wars. Any given battle roughly comes down to kill ratio times number of units, assuming both sides have roughly similar unit counts. This means that winning on kill ratio is irrelevant if the opponent has a much larger unit production advantage. This It would also obviously be ridiculous for the Roadster to achieve simply the same 0-60mph time as Model S, even though it is a 2 door fully performance-oriented vehicle"

And, of course, our amazing President Please let us know if you have any difficulties voting your Tesla stock Congrats Tesla Fremont team! Please reply in comments if you’re having difficulty voting your Tesla shares"
2024-05-19,This is concerning. Tesla will reach out to these banks/brokers. Shareholders have the right to vote their shares!
2024-05-20,"In sharp contrast, 𝕏 supports child safety bills Wind turbines are fine if out of the way where they aren’t an eyesore. They are competitive when paired with batteries. Nuclear fission is a no-brainer. We should have a lot more of it. The Tesla team put this together of their own volition (I did not ask for it). Thanks! Should be very rare after the 12.4 rollout. We have to sync up vehicle software (way too many hardware variants) with FSD. And the roof will be fully covered by solar, except for the word “TESLA”, which will be gently outlined in light, so you can see it at night from airliners coming into Austin"

2024-06-01,"FSD will have chill, standard and hurry modes"
2024-06-03,Tesla went public at $1.5B valuation 14 years ago. Valuation today is over $500B.
2024-06-04,"Training compute for Tesla is relatively small compared to inference compute, as the latter scales linearly with size of fleet. Perhaps the best way to think about it is in terms of power consumption. When the Tesla fleet reaches 100M vehicles, peak power consumption of AI Of the roughly $10B in AI-related expenditures I said Tesla would make this year, about half is internal, primarily the Tesla-designed AI inference computer and sensors present in all of our cars, plus Dojo. For building the AI training superclusters, NVidia hardware is about Tesla had no place to send the Nvidia chips to turn them on, so they would have just sat in a warehouse. The south extension of Giga Texas is almost complete. This will house 50k H100s for FSD training."
2024-06-05,"How to vote your Tesla shares FSD 12.4.1 releases today to Tesla employees. If that goes well, then it will be released to a limited number of external customers this weekend. There are a massive number of changes to this build. It should arguably be called v13, but we’re sticking to 12 Two other The existing factory space was already allocated to vehicle, battery and cell production. And this is not a matter of tucking a few computers into a corner. You need a kW of power and cooling for each GPU, which would mean 12MW of power and 12MW of cooling. The south extension"
2024-06-07,"They deserve to repay Tesla legal costs and get nothing! Worth mentioning that switching to ultra hard, cold-rolled stainless steel for Starship is what led me to make Cybertruck out of it too"
2024-06-08,Please take a moment to vote your Tesla shares before the annual meeting on Thursday. Lmk in comments if you encounter any issues. Straight from the onboard cameras with no post-production. This is literally what you’d see if you looked out the window.
2024-06-09,"Thanks Milan! You’ve built the Optimus team from nothing to the most sophisticated humanoid robot in the world. Thanks Ashok! Ashok was the first person to join the Tesla AI/Autopilot team and ultimately rose to lead all AI/Autopilot software. Without him and our awesome team, we would just be another car company looking for an autonomy supplier that doesn’t exist. Btw, I never No Model Y “refresh” is coming out this year. I should note that Tesla continuously improves its cars, so even a car that is 6 months newer will be a little better. I’ve mentioned something like this before, but, if any of my companies goes public, we will prioritize other longtime shareholders of my other companies, including Tesla. Loyalty deserves loyalty."
2024-06-10,It comes down to what you think the ratio of humanoid robots to humans will be. My guess is that it will be &gt;&gt;1.
2024-06-12,"Cybertruck is an APC from the future We could, but hopefully it isn’t needed. Tesla is one of the few companies that has its own tech stack (not iOS, Android or forked Android). I’m curious to read this. The more I think about robotaxis and humanoid robots, the more absurd the valuation becomes. They have been the most accurate predictors of the value of Tesla"

Sizing for ~130MW of power &amp; cooling this year, but will increase to &gt;500MW over next 18 months or so. Aiming for about half Tesla AI hardware, half Nvidia/other. Play to win or don’t play at all."
2024-06-23,"We could build a lot more, but the next version of Raptor is really the one to scale up production. We begin testing it in McGregor within a week or so. Regenerative cooling and secondary flow paths have been made integral to the whole engine, thus no heat shield is required."

2024-07-11,"Good Tesla self-driving demo. It’s true, buying anything except a Tesla will seem like buying a horse &amp; buggy. Nikola Tesla was great and AC was the right move back then. These days, with the proliferation of electronics that use DC and advanced power electronics, it would be better to use DC. High voltage DC is also materially more efficient for long distance electricity From Grok 🤣🤣 Well, well, well, if it isn't our favorite stock market soothsayer, Jim ""Reverse Midas Touch"" Cramer, back at it again with his crystal ball predictions. This time, he's foretelling a bright future for Tesla, claiming it could soon reach a $1 trillion market cap."
2024-07-12,New Tesla Model 3 version available in America. 363 miles of range for $35k! The amount of testing time it takes to figure out if the new AI is better than the existing AI as measured by miles between interventions is the limiting factor on progress. The better FSD gets the longer it takes to find interventions.
2024-07-13,They are contemptible parasites on the neck of Tesla
2024-07-14,Dangerous times ahead. Two people (separate occasions) have already tried to kill me in the past 8 months. They were arrested with guns about 20 mins drive from Tesla HQ in Texas.
